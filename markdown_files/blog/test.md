## We just raised $125M in a round led by Mary Meeker at Kleiner Perkins. Here’s what we’re going to do with it.

2018 is shaping up to be a massive year for the Intercom platform. Historically, we’ve spent proportionately way more on research and development than other software companies we track, and that won’t stop any time soon. This funding will go straight into building great new software at a pace you’ve yet to see from us. Last year, we shipped 156 new things. Now we’re accelerating that pace, and last month we announced we’re doubling our entire R&D orgs in San Francisco, London, and Dublin over the next 18 months. So at a high level, here’s what we’re working on next.

### Substantially improving our existing products, especially for bigger businesses

All disruptive technologies start selling first to small companies, the early adopters in a market. Then, as the customer base and market matures, successful disruptive technologies evolve with them, adding the sophistication that ever larger customers need as they scale. Salesforce is a great example of this – when they started, they focused on sales teams with only 5 reps.

Intercom is yet another example, where at the start, we sold to tiny businesses. That segment is still crucial to us today, and we’ll continue to serve them well. Yet our success there is becoming clear – in the last Y Combinator batch, 84% of all companies with a messenger or live chat product on their site used Intercom. Our next frontier is the generation or two further along than them.

    Our team uses RealtimeBoard as a virtual whiteboard 
    for Scrum. It makes doing Scrum with remote teams 
    much easier. We have moved all of our Scrum processes 
    (planning, Backlog grooming, Scrum status, etc.) 
    to RealtimeBoard, so we can do all of our collaboration 
    there.</strong>

#### Intercom has three cool things going for it in these respects:
1. Our applications were built as a suite from day one. So the workflows across your sales, marketing and support teams are connected in a way that you don’t get when you buy different products from different vendors – or sometimes even from the same vendor! This means that cross-application technologies (like our Operator bot) can join dots in pretty unique ways.
2. Our Messenger directly interacts with the end user. So we can not only build cool things to join dots across teams, but also between you and your customer. So much of the potential for smart automation in this space lies in the interactions between the business and the customer.
3. Finally, the data you store about your customers in your Intercom database is incredibly and uniquely rich. This will become invaluable training data to help you better serve your customers in the future.
