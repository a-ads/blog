If you invite others to advertise with A-ADS, you can count on 10% of money spent by your referral. When somebody follows you partner link, we use a cookie to track his activity. An advertiser is considered your referral for 6 months after he created a campaign or a user account via your link. Our payouts are transparent and you can see them here: <https://a-ads.com/campaigns/1/goals>

You can create an affiliate ad unit here: <https://a-ads.com/ad_units/new>

But actually ad units of "site" and "app" types can work as affiliate ones by default. An affiliate link is generated automatically for any ad unit, it can be found in the bottom right corner of an ad unit page.
