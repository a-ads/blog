# How to Earn Cryptocurrency in 2022

If you think that it is too late to earn some crypto, you are wrong. The truth is, there are still hundreds of options on how to do it. ‘Cuz let’s be honest, everyone wants to earn some cryptocurrency. And as the 2022 context shows us, getting some crypto can also be an efficient precaution against inflation and the banking system’s failure.

But, we all remember that the crypto market can be pretty uncertain, so we don’t want to risk our hard-earned money. No worries! Let’s browse the best ways to get some crypto coins at a minimum risk and even minimum effort. Yeah, this is possible, follow me!

## 10 ways to earn cryptocurrency

### 1. Start mining cryptocurrency

It seems obvious that you should just start mining crypto. But, the problem is that it doesn’t work for all currencies.

In a nutshell, mining is the process that cryptocurrencies use to generate new coins and verify new transactions. But this process is rather complex and involves huge decentralized networks of computers around the world. Every transaction made is being documented through verified and secure blockchains, which are virtual ledgers. As the computers in the network contribute to their processing power, they are then being rewarded with some new coins. So, it goes in circles when the miners maintain the blockchain and keep it secure, the blockchain in its return provides the miners with the coins. 

A decade ago, when we all lived in a slighlty better world, anyone with a home computer could organize mining for crypto at their homes. You did not need some super power to do so. But, as the blockchain has grown, the computation power demanded to maintain it has surged.

Now, you can hardly be successful in mining anything profitable. Plus, all mining is now done by specialized companies or groups of people who band their resources together.

But if you want to try your luck with crypto mining, you don’t have to invest thousands of dollars to get started. You can always join a mining network. All you have to do is pay the joining fee, and then you can work together with other members to mine. The only disadvantage is that you’ll also have to split the rewards.

Check out some of the best cryptocurrencies (besides bitcoin) that you can mine right now:

Ethereum (ETH)

Monero (XMR)

Dash (DASH)

Litecoin (LTC)

CoinGecko is a great resource to stay updated with crypto prices and decide whether a coin is worth mining or buying. 

### **2. Earn crypto by buying**

Buying crypto seems like the most straightforward way to get some coins, right? Plus, it has never been easier than before. As the industry became so super duper popular in the past few years, its demand skyrocketed. Many companies have started offering services that enable anyone to easily and safely enter the market.

So, how can you buy cryptocurrency in 2022? Easy-peasy!

Let’s start with bitcoin. Buying this coin can be as simple as pie. You just go to a bitcoin ATM and get it with cash or credit. Though other crypto coins aren’t so accessible, so you can only buy them via crypto exchanges. But there’s one thing you should think of, such as transaction fees.

On most online exchanges, the transaction fees are updated in real-time, based on  market changes. And the fees themselves are pretty low.

ATMs, on the other hand, usually have high transaction fees. So it’s usually advised to buy coins through exchanges such as Coinbase, Binance, or Kraken. All you have to do is sign up for an account and verify it. 

But you should remember, some exchanges require verification from your bank, and this process can take up to several weeks.

Another option is a decentralized exchange (DEX) such as Uniswap or PancakeSwap. The compliance requirements are usually lower and may approve your account faster. But, keep in mind that trading tokens on a DEX is even riskier than on a centralized exchange.

### **3. Earn cryptocurrency by watching videos**

This way is rather easy but not a smooth landscape yet. Most of the payouts are very low, and the videos can be boring to watch, cuz they are mostly ads. But there are some interesting projects that go beyond advertising as well. 

One way is to use a site like CoinTube. CoinTube is a site that allows you to watch videos about cryptocurrencies and earn bitcoin in the process. All you need to do is create an account, and then start watching videos. The site pays out every Monday.

Another way to earn free crypto coins is to use a site like Cointiply. You will need to complete some tasks, such as watching videos. You can also earn bitcoin by playing games.

One more option that functions in a similar way is the CoinmarketCap Learning Center. Coinmarketcap has different videos and requires you to take a short quiz afterward, but the payouts and educational value are also high. You can also go for Odysee, which is positioned as an answer to Youtube, Permission.io, and PlayNano Online. This one specifically, is a project that lets you earn Nano by watching videos, playing games, completing surveys, and other activities.

### 4. Earn crypto by staking

First of all, what’s staking? Let me explain, staking is a way to put your crypto to work and earn rewards on it. The primary benefit of staking is that you earn more crypto, and interest rates can be very generous. Cool, right? 

As many crypto coins verify their transactions, staking allows participants to earn rewards on their holdings. It can be a great way to use your crypto to generate some passive income, especially because some cryptocurrencies offer high interest rates for staking. 

Ok, ready to take some easy steps? Follow me! 

First, you should buy a cryptocurrency that uses proof-of stake. Here are a few of the major cryptocurrencies you can steak in:

Ethereum (CRYPTO:ETH) was the first cryptocurrency with a programmable blockchain that developers can use to create apps.

Cardano (CRYPTO:ADA) is an eco-friendly cryptocurrency. It was founded on peer-reviewed research and developed through evidence-based methods.

Polkadot (CRYPTO:DOT) is a protocol that allows different blockchains to connect and work with one another.

Secondly, transfer your crypto to a blockchain wallet. After you buy your crypto, it will be available on the exchange where you purchased it. Some exchanges have their own staking programs with select cryptocurrencies. If that's the case, you can just stake crypto directly on the exchange. While staking can work differently depending on the cryptocurrency, most use staking pools. Research the staking pools available for the cryptocurrency you have. But! I want to warn you, that  there are a few risks to staking crypto, you should understand. Crypto prices are volatile and can drop quickly. If your staked assets suffer a large price drop, that could outweigh any interest you earn on them.

Also keep in mind that staking can require that you lock up your coins for a minimum amount of time. During that period, you're unable to do anything with your staked assets, such as sell them. I warned you, bro.

### 5. Get crypto with DeFi

Ok, now we will talk about the next level of complexity. Don't worry, I am with you here. So, in the most straightforward understanding of this process, Yield Farming is a method of generating rewards from locking up cryptocurrencies. As you lock in your funds and grant liquidity to a Defi token, you will get rewards and interest. Depending on the project, you can get additional tokens besides the yield. Not so complicated, right?

Some of the most prominent DeFis that you can mine right now are Compound (COMP), Kyber Network (KNC), 0x (ZRX), and Ren (REN).

### 6. Earn cryptocurrency by playing games

You can not only play games, but earn some crypto! Sounds awesome, right?

Plus, the Play to Earn crypto games concept is the hottest trend nowadays. Let's take a look inside to see what's really possible. These unique games have native tokens supporting game economies. You buy, trade, sell, and play with these in-game currencies.

But, some games are premium needing an initial investment to start with, while some you play for free. And one more thing I should mention, most of these games are in early development, so lower your expectations, and don’t wait for some super modern good-looking games here. But keep your focus on the economics, and the rewards, not the game itself. Now, let’s look closer. You can check out Axie Infinity for the beginning. This game is the top P2E crypto game, consistently in the news for providing household income in some weaker economies. The game requires three Axies (in-game creatures) that you can purchase from their marketplace.

Then, Plant Vs. Undead. This game is about a meteorite-hit planet in which the animals have turned into the undead trying to kill the mother trees. However, the flora has evolved too, fully prepared to fight the adversaries. The native token is PVU stored on Binance's Smart Chain, whereas the in-game currency is named Light Energy (LE).

And one more thing to mention, is The Sandbox. It has multiple ways to earn. You can be an artist, game maker, or landowner to earn SAND, the cryptocurrency.

There are plenty of other games to choose from, but bear in mind, you should be careful of the games asking for initial investments, owing to the crypto volatility.

### 7. Earn Cryptocurrency joining a network of publishers

Do you have a website or a blog? Then you can start earning some coins. It is easy, let me show you how. 

Since Google banned or restricted crypto-related businesses from advertising through its network, the advertising industry had to adapt. Countless crypto ad networks (such as A-ADS) were created to fill the market’s advertising needs. Their platforms created vast networks of crypto publishers, where advertisers could place their banners.

So, let me tell you about the advantages that our Publishers can get. Firstly, it takes less than a minute to become a publisher! You should go to our website and follow three steps. Ready? Here, what you should do:

### 8. Accept crypto payments

One more way to earn some crypto coins is to start accepting crypto payments. If you own an e-commerce website, then it’s your time to shine. The process isn’t complicated. Platforms such as Shopify or WooCommerce allow their customers  to accept cryptocurrencies as payment through their website.

And not talking only bitcoin. For example, WooCommerce allows its users to accept some 50 types of crypto coins, while Shopify goes even higher, with more than 300.

If we talk about Shopify, all you have to do is enable an alternative payment method from your Shopify account.

For WooCommerce, you’ll have to install one (or more) additional plugin, such as BitPay or CoinGate. When installed, just activate it, configure it, and you’re good to go.

### 9. Start freelancing and get paid in bitcoin

Maybe this is not an obvious way, but definitely one of the easiest to try! You can earn coins  by securing a job that pays in cryptocurrency. And you  will be surprised as to how many online platforms have set it as their Payment method.

Heaps of platforms facilitate freelancing through blockchain technology. . Most of them don’t have any costs or transaction fees, so freelancers receive precisely what the employer pays.

Feel uncertain to receive your paycheck in crypto due to volatility? No worries! You can always opt for a more stable cryptocurrency. You can start your crypto freelance career with such places as  CryptoGrind, BlockLancer, BitGigs Earn, and some others. 

### 10. Use cryptocurrency and payment platforms

The last, but not the least, is the way to profit from cash back functionality.

Cryptocurrency and payment platforms like Crypto.com now offer financial management applications that can help you earn more cryptos using the funds you already have.

Not counting earning cryptocurrencies from depositing and picking up the interest, you can profit from cash back functionality.
