if you’re a regular Sketch user you probably use at least a couple of plugins everyday. Whether you need help creating awesome animations, adding data visualizations to your interfaces or simply managing your components, Sketch’s expansive plugin ecosystem has a tool to help.

Plugins and the incredible community that develop them are a huge part of what makes Sketch great. In this new series we’re going to be rounding up some of the best plugins and integrations for extending the functionality of Sketch. In our first instalment, we’ve got five plugins to help you speed up your workflow.

## We don’t collet any personal data of network users.

If you work in any creative industry it’s likely you’ve already heard of WeTransfer — one of the simplest and most popular file sending services around.

The plugin works in real time, identifying inconsistencies while you work so you don’t have to wait until the end of a project to start looking for issues. Roller lets you add your style guide so you can check for conflicts, and, if you don’t have a style guide, the plugin uses data trends based on frequently used styles to warn you about inconsistent elements.

### Intercom has three cool things going for it in these respects:

* Our applications were built as a suite from day one. So the workflows across your sales, marketing and support teams are connected in a way that you don’t get when you buy different products from different vendors – or sometimes even from the same vendor!
* Our Messenger directly interacts with the end user. So we can not only build cool things to join dots across teams, but also between you and your customer. So much of the potential for smart automation in this space lies in the interactions between the business and the customer.
* Finally, the data you store about your customers in your Intercom database is incredibly and uniquely rich. This will become invaluable training data to help you better serve your customers in the future.
