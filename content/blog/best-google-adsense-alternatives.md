## What is Google Adsense?

Google AdSense is a well-known advertising program that is broadly used worldwide. It’s also the most popular pay-per-click (PPC) program on the web, and many publishers like AdSense as it allows them to integrate with the Google ecosystem quite easily. 

However, despite it being relatively easy to obtain permission to display ads, not everyone succeeds on the first try. Sometimes, second attempts may require the order to successfully pass the review criteria put in place by the company itself to ensure only the highest quality publishers join the network to advertise products and services using its platform. In this article we will explore the best Google AdSense alternative.

## AdSense Advantages and Disadvantages 

AdSense has become one of the most popular ways for webmasters and bloggers to make money from their content, but it’s not without its drawbacks. Let’s discuss the advantages and disadvantages of AdSense so you can decide if it’s right for you. 

### AdSense advantages: 

1. Easy to Set Up

 One of the most significant advantages of Adsense is how easy it is to set up an account and start publishing ads on your website, forum or blog. All you have to do is sign up with Google, enter basic information about yourself and your site, and then paste some code into your pages or template files (if using WordPress). Once approved by Google (which usually takes less than 24 hours), ads will start appearing on all applicable pages within minutes.

1. Flexible Payment Options

With AdSense, there are several payment options available, such as a direct deposit into a bank account or a check mailed directly from Google each month, depending on where in the world you live, making payments quick & hassle-free no matter what country/currency combination works best for you.

3. High CPM Rates 

The cost per thousand impressions (CPM) rate offered by AdSense tends to be higher than other ad networks, which means more money is earned per pageview generated from visitors clicking through advertisements displayed across different sites around the internet space. 

### AdSense disadvantages

While AdSense offers several advantages for website owners and their ad campaign, there are also some disadvantages. Here are a few of AdSense disadvantages:

1. Limited Selection of Ad Types

AdSense offers a limited range of ad types, which may not always align with the preferences or requirements of website owners.

2. Payment Threshold

AdSense has a payment threshold that website owners must reach before receiving their earnings. This threshold is set at $100, which means that website owners need to accumulate at least $100 in earnings before they can receive a payment.

3. Lack of Control Over Displayed Ads

While AdSense provides some control over the types of ads displayed on a website, website owners do not have complete control over the specific ads that appear. This lack of control can sometimes result in ads that are not relevant or suitable for the website's audience.

4. Competition for Ad Space

AdSense operates on an auction-based system, where advertisers bid for ad space on websites. This means that website owners may not always receive the highest-paying ads, resulting in potentially lower earnings.

5. Interstitial and Vignette Ads

Some website owners find interstitial and vignette ads obnoxious or disruptive to the user experience. These types of ads may negatively impact the overall user satisfaction of the website.

![alternatives to google adsence](/blog/assets/alternatives-to-google-adsence-on-advertising-market.webp)

Taking into consideration all the pros and cons of AdSense, publishers should explore other options beyond AdSense, not only as a replacement but as a complement to optimize ad revenue. 

In this article, we’ll discuss why you prefer a different ad network for your site. Then, we’ll explore the best ad networks outside of AdSense you can use to quickly begin monetizing your blog.

## Reasons to Use an Alternative to AdSense 

Google AdSense is a popular advertising network. However, there are several reasons why you might consider using an alternative to AdSense in 2023:

### 1. Eligibility Requirements

One of the main reasons to seek an alternative to AdSense is the eligibility requirements. AdSense has strict criteria that websites must meet before being approved for the program. This includes having a certain amount of traffic and adhering to Google's content policies. If your website does not meet these requirements, you may need to find an alternative network with more relaxed approval requirements.

### 2. Revenue Share

Another consideration is the revenue share offered by AdSense. While AdSense provides a competitive revenue share of 68%, there are alternative networks that offer an even greater share. If you have a top-notch website with high and steady traffic, you may be able to qualify for a higher revenue share with another network.

### **3. Ad Customization**

AdSense has some limitations when it comes to ad customization. While you can customize the size and placement of ads, the level of customization is limited compared to some alternative networks. Some networks allow you to tailor the look of your ads to match your website's theme, providing a more seamless integration of ads with your content.

### 4. Minimum Payout

AdSense has a minimum payout threshold of $100, which may be higher than some alternative networks. If your website is smaller or less established, it could take longer to reach this minimum payout. In such cases, partnering with a network that offers a lower minimum payout could be more beneficial.

### 5. Tailoring for Your Blog

While AdSense is a versatile platform that works well for all types of content-heavy sites, there may be instances where you want a more customized solution for your specific blog or forum. In such cases, it makes sense to seek out an alternative network that can provide a custom-fit solution tailored to your niche and audience.

### 6. Additional Revenue Sources

Instead of replacing AdSense entirely, you may consider using a companion network that runs alongside AdSense. This can provide an additional source of revenue without violating AdSense's terms of service. By diversifying your revenue sources, you can maximize your earning potential.

## Best AdSense Alternatives 

Now that we've discussed the reasons to consider an alternative to AdSense let's explore some of the best adsense alternatives available in the market. These alternatives offer unique features and benefits that may better suit your specific needs and bring a great number of ad impressions to your platform, forum or blog.

List of best Google AdSense alternatives for publishers:

* Ezoic
* AdThrive
* Mediavine
* Media.net
* AdMob
* Carbon Ads
* Bidvertiser
* Infolinks
* Adcash
* Revcontent
* Sovrn
* PropellerAds

### 1. Ezoic

Ezoic is an innovative platform that provides website owners with powerful tools to optimize their websites and monetize their content. Unlike AdSense, which focuses solely on ads as its primary revenue source, Ezoic offers a wide range of features, including A/B testing tools and advanced analytics, which allow users to quickly identify areas of improvement in order to maximize profits from all sources, including display ads. 

Furthermore, unlike many other ad networks out there that require large amounts of traffic before they will approve your site for monetization, Ezoic has no minimum traffic requirements, meaning even small sites can take advantage of this great service straight away! Additionally, it also allows publishers more control over what types of adverts are displayed on their sites by providing them with the ability to set up rules-based targeting options, allowing them greater flexibility when it comes time to choose what type of content should be shown, resulting in better user experiences overall. 

Finally, one key feature setting it apart from other platforms is its automated optimization system called “SmartSwitch,” which constantly monitors performance across multiple metrics such as pageviews per visitor and click-through rate (CTR), then automatically adjusts settings accordingly, ensuring maximum profitability at all times without any manual intervention required making life much easier for busy webmasters who don’t have time manually tweak every single element themselves. 

### 2. AdThrive

AdThrive is a premium ad network that offers high-quality ads and personalized support for publishers. It works closely with publishers to develop a monetization strategy and optimize ad placements.

AdThrive offers several advantages over other alternatives, such as: 

• Higher CPMs – With higher CPMs than most of its competitors, including AdSense, it allows website owners to earn more money per impression or click on ads. 

• Faster Payments – Unlike many other networks, which take weeks or months to pay out earnings, payments through this network are made within days after the end of each month. 

 • Comprehensive Reporting System - The reporting system provided by this platform is comprehensive and easy to use, allowing users to track their performance in real-time and make informed decisions regarding optimization efforts & campaigns accordingly.  

### 3. Mediavine

Mediavine is another popular ad network known for its high-quality ads and personalized support. It offers a revenue share of 75% to publishers and focuses on lifestyle bloggers. With a lower minimum traffic requirement of 50,000 monthly pageviews, Mediavine is accessible to medium-sized bloggers and provides a user-friendly interface and transparent reporting.

Why is Mediavine a better alternative than AdSense? 

*  Mediavine has higher payouts than Adsense - up to 10 times more! This means that if you generate 1 million page views per month with AdSense, then in comparison with Mediainve, you could earn $10k instead of $1k.
* Mediavine also provides more transparency and control over how ads are served on your site compared to Google's black box approach used by most other networks, such as Google AdSense. With MediaVine's dashboard tools, you have complete control over where ads appear on each page of your site, as well as their frequency and size. 
* MediaVine also offers exclusive features like header bidding, which allows multiple ad partners to compete at once – providing increased competition among buyers resulting in higher CPM rates (cost-per-thousand impressions) for publishers who use this feature. Plus, they offer access to a wide range of high-quality demand sources from major brands, including the Amazon Associates program & Microsoft Advertising Exchange.

Finally, unlike some other platforms out there today – setting up an account with Medaivne is a free & simple process: no need to wait long periods of time before getting approved either.

### 4. Media.net

Media.net is a contextual ad network powered by Bing and Yahoo that offers native advertising solutions. In 2023 it provides highly targeted ads that seamlessly integrate with your website's content. Media.net requires high-quality content and a clean, professional design for approval. It offers competitive payouts and a minimum payout threshold of $100.

In addition, Media.net typically pays higher rates for contextual ads, especially for websites in specific niches like finance and technology. Media.net works extremely well in some niches and can outperform AdSense in terms of revenue generation. If your website or content falls into a niche that aligns well with Media.net's advertisers, you may see better results with this platform.

### 5. AdMob

AdMob, owned by Google, is a popular alternative for monetizing mobile apps, especially for Android. It offers a variety of ad formats, including banner ads, interstitial ads, and rewarded video ads. AdMob provides robust analytics and optimization tools to help you maximize your app's revenue potential.

AdMob offers various ad formats and targeting options tailored for mobile apps, making it a suitable choice for developers looking to generate revenue from their apps.

Another striking feature is that AdMob tends to offer higher revenue potential compared to AdSense for mobile app developers. This is because mobile apps often have higher engagement rates and can provide more targeted advertising opportunities, resulting in potentially higher earnings.

Finally, AdMob provides seamless integration with mobile apps, allowing developers to easily implement ads within their app's user interface. It offers a range of ad formats, including banner ads, interstitial ads, and rewarded video ads, which can be customized to fit the app's design and user experience.

### 6. Carbon Ads

Carbon Ads is a niche ad network that focuses on targeting developers and designers. If your audience falls into this category, Carbon Ads can provide relevant and high-quality ads that align with their interests. It also offers a simple integration process and provides reporting and analytics tools to track your ad performance.

In addition, Carbon Ads offers more control over where the ads are positioned. This level of control may be appealing to certain publishers who want more flexibility in ad placement.

### 7.  Bidvertiser

AdSense is a well-established and widely used advertising platform, while Bidvertiser may not have the same level of market share or reputation yet. However, a Bidvertiser is an advertising platform that operates on a bidding campaign system. Instead of placing ads automatically, Bidvertiser allows advertisers to bid for ad space on your website, maximizing your revenue potential. 

Bidvertiser offers various ad formats, including XML feeds, pop-unders, sliders, and text ads. It also provides detailed ad modifications and optimization options for publishers.

Bidvertiser has a minimum payout threshold of $10, which means you can receive payments relatively quickly. 

### 8. Infolinks

Infolinks offers a unique approach to ad monetization with its in-text advertising placement. It scans your blog's content for relevant keywords and automatically associates ads with those keywords. When a visitor hovers over the highlighted text, a relevant ad appears. InfoLinks also offers targeted display ads as an alternative option. It has no minimum traffic requirements, making it accessible to new websites.

### 9. Adcash

Adcash is an ad-serving platform that offers a wide range of ad formats, including banners, pop-unders, sliders, and native ads. It provides advanced targeting capabilities, allowing you to reach your desired audience effectively. Adcash covers a large number of countries and offers competitive revenue share options. It is suitable for both small and large publishers.

However, Adcash may not have the same level of market share or reputation.

### 10. Revcontent

Revcontent is a native advertising network that focuses on delivering high-quality ads that match the look and feel of your website. It partners with publishers that generate a lot of hits on ads, attracting advertisers willing to pay higher commissions.

### 11.  Sovrn

It provides programmatic advertising technologies and real-time bidding capabilities to help publishers maximize their revenue. Sovrn supports publishers of all sizes and offers specialized support for onboarding and troubleshooting.

### 12. PropellerAds

PropellerAds is a great option as an AdSense alternative. This innovative ad network offers users the opportunity to monetize their websites and apps with high-quality ads that generate revenue. With its advanced targeting capabilities, it can deliver relevant ads quickly and easily.

PropellerAds also provides detailed analytics that allows users to track performance in real time, giving them greater insight into how well their campaigns are doing and what changes they need to make to maximize earnings potential. It also integrates seamlessly with major platforms like Google Adwords, allowing marketers access to more comprehensive data about customer behavior across multiple channels - invaluable information when creating effective marketing strategies.

Additionally, PropellerAds has built-in fraud protection measures that protect advertisers from fraudulent activity such as clickbots or invalid clicks generated by malicious sources - something all too common on other networks but not here! Lastly – this platform pays out fast; payouts are done within 24 hours of request (depending on the method chosen), making it a simple yet secure way for publishers to earn money online without waiting weeks, as some other networks require. 

### 13. Amazon Native Shopping Ads

As one of the largest e-commerce platforms in the world, Amazon offers its own ad program called Amazon Native Shopping Ads. This program allows you to display native product listings on your website, targeted based on the surrounding content. When a visitor clicks on one of these ads and makes a purchase on Amazon, you earn a commission. Amazon Native Shopping Ads can be a great choice if your website's audience wants to purchase products online.

### 14. Outbrain

Outbrain is a leading content discovery platform that delivers relevant and engaging content recommendations to users. It provides native ads that blend seamlessly with your website's content, increasing user engagement and click-through rates. Outbrain uses advanced algorithms to match your content with the most suitable ads, ensuring a personalized and non-disruptive user experience. The platform also offers real-time analytics and reporting to help you track your ad performance.

### 15. AdRecover

If you've experienced a decline in revenue due to ad blockers, AdRecover can help you recover lost ad revenue. It bypasses ad blockers by displaying a polite message to users, asking them to whitelist your website. AdRecover then serves ads to these users, allowing you to monetize your content effectively. This can be especially beneficial for websites with a high percentage of ad-blocking users.

### 16. PopAds

PopAds specializes in pop-under ads, which open in a new browser window behind the current window. While pop-under ads may not be suitable for every website, they can be a lucrative option if implemented correctly. PopAds offers high rates and worldwide coverage, making it an attractive choice for publishers looking to monetize their traffic effectively. The platform provides real-time reporting and a user-friendly interface to track your earnings and optimize your campaigns.

### 17. Vidoomy

### 19. PubMatic

PubMatic has become an increasingly attractive alternative to AdSense for market specialists, bloggers, and crypto owners who want to maximize their earning potential. PubMatic offers higher CPM rates than other ad networks like AdSense, meaning you can earn more money per impression. 

With PubMatic, you have greater control over which ads appear on your site and where they are placed, so you can ensure maximum visibility and engagement with your audience without compromising user experience or brand integrity. You also have access to real-time reporting features that allow you to track performance metrics in detail so you know exactly how well each campaign is performing at any given time.  

Unlike many other ad networks, including Adsense, PubMatic gives publishers access to direct demand from premium advertisers such as Amazon Advertising Platform (AAP), Microsoft Advertising Exchange (MSX), AppNexus Open Auction, Rubicon Project's Private Marketplace, etc., enabling them to reach larger audiences while increasing revenue opportunities significantly. 

Lastly, Pubmatic provides comprehensive support services through its dedicated account managers, who work closely with publishers throughout the onboarding process, ensuring all queries are addressed promptly & efficiently. 

### 20. SHE Media

SHE Media is a unique media platform that offers content creators the opportunity to monetize their work through sponsored posts and campaigns with major brands. This gives content creators access to new audiences while also earning revenue from their efforts. 

Unlike AdSense, which requires strict compliance with its terms of service in order for publishers and website owners to be eligible for payment, SHE Media provides more flexibility when it comes to the types of promotions they will accept from advertisers or partners. For example, advertisers can create custom campaigns that are tailored specifically towards your audience rather than relying on generic ads served by Google’s algorithms, like what happens with AdSense ads. 

Additionally, since there are no minimum requirements needed to become an approved publisher on SHEMedia's platform - this makes them a much easier option if you're just starting out building up a following or don't have any previous experience working with ad networks like Adsense does require before approving applications. 

Furthermore, unlike most other ad networks where payments only occur after certain thresholds (such as reaching $100) – SheMedia pays out monthly regardless of total earnings, so you won't need to worry about waiting around long periods before seeing any return investments made into creating quality content. 

Overall, SheMedia provides a great alternative for anyone looking to generate additional income streams without having to deal with all the restrictions that come along with using traditional methods, such as advertising platforms like Google AdSense.

## How Much Traffic do you Need to Make Money from Ads?

Making money from ads is a great way to monetize your website or blog, but many people don't realize that the amount of traffic you need depends on several factors. Traffic is an important factor in determining how much money you can make from ads, as it directly affects the number of impressions and click-through rates (CTR). 

The more visitors you have to your site, the higher the chance for increased ad revenue. However, this doesn’t mean that having more traffic will automatically translate into higher earnings; there are other factors involved, such as cost per impression (CPM), cost per click (CPC), and various targeting options available through different ad networks. 

For example, if your CPM rate is low, then even with high levels of traffic, it may not be worth running any advertisements at all unless they are highly targeted campaigns focusing on specific demographics or interests, which could result in better returns than just relying solely on general advertising methods like banner banners, etc. Similarly, CPC rates also vary depending upon what type of product/service is being advertised, and understanding these variables helps optimize performance when trying to maximize earnings via advertisement placements. 

It's better to keep track of metrics such as page views and unique visits so that one can determine whether their efforts are resulting in desired outcomes, i.e., enough income generated from ads placed across multiple channels, including social media sites & search engines, etc. 

Additionally, tracking user engagement data like time spent by users browsing content & clicking links within articles/pages helps users to provide insight into visitor behavior.

## What Type of Ads Work Best?

What type of ads work best depends on a variety of factors, from the audience you're targeting to the medium in which you’re advertising. 

For market specialists, traditional print or television advertisements can be effective for reaching large numbers of potential customers quickly. However, digital marketing strategies such as search engine optimization (SEO) and pay-per-click (PPC) campaigns are also highly effective for driving traffic and conversions online. Additionally, social media channels like Facebook Ads offer great opportunities to target specific audiences with tailored messaging that resonates with them directly—especially if they’ve already expressed interest in similar products or services before seeing your ad. 

Bloggers have unique opportunities when it comes to advertising their content since they often have direct access to their readership base through comment sections on blogs or other platforms like Twitter, where conversations about topics related to their blog posts take place regularly. By leveraging these channels effectively—by responding thoughtfully yet promptly whenever possible—bloggers can build relationships with readers that will result in more clicks on sponsored links within blog posts themselves as well as higher engagement rates overall across all social networks used by bloggers themselves and those who follow them closely alike. 

Crypto owners should consider using native cryptocurrency advertisement networks such as AADS, which specialize specifically in placing targeted crypto ads across multiple web properties, including websites owned by publishers who accept payment via cryptocurrencies only – this way, crypto owners can ensure maximum visibility while keeping costs down due both its specialized nature & competitive pricing structure offered by these types of services compared against more generalist solutions available elsewhere online today.

## Final Thoughts on Google AdSense Alternatives    

While Google AdSense is a popular choice for website monetization, exploring alternative ad networks can provide you with additional revenue opportunities, customization options, and targeted ads for specific niches. By considering the eligibility requirements, revenue share, customization features, and minimum payout thresholds of different networks, you can choose the best alternative that suits your website or YouTube channel.

Remember to prioritize the user experience and ensure that your ads are relevant and non-intrusive. Test and optimize different ad placements and formats to maximize your earnings while maintaining a positive user experience.
