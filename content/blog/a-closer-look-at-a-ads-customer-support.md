Customer support is crucial for any company. It acts as the backbone to ensure that customers are satisfied. In this article, we look closer at the inner workings of AADS' customer support team, shedding light on their essential role and the work behind their operations.

At AADS, exceptional products and services are only half the equation. That's why we place utmost importance on our customer support team. We recognize their crucial role in maintaining a seamless experience for our valued customers and site users. Daily, we receive approximately 200 requests that showcase our customers' trust in us.

Operating around the clock, our customer support team guarantees a rapid response, regardless of the day or hour. Our average response time is only 15 minutes, and we aim to surpass expectations by often providing even quicker assistance. We are proud of our diverse team, which consists of multilingual experts who can communicate in several languages. It helps us to bridge language barriers and engage with customers in their native tongue, understand them more profoundly, and solve problems more efficiently. 

What's more is that the entire AADS team operates remotely, which illustrates our commitment to flexibility and adaptability. We've included a map highlighting their locations to show where our support team members are located worldwide (see picture below).

"There are already eight people in my team, and this number is growing, as with the development of the service, we receive more and more users and requests," - says the Head of Support, Alexandra.

"Every new person in the team undergoes a mandatory one-week training, as it is important that clients receive only reliable and accurate information."

### What numbers say

At AADS, we know that making our customers happy is an ongoing process, not just a one-time goal. That's why we carefully track how well our support team performs weekly. It helps us see how effective our work is and where we can improve. We take pride in sharing that our average user rating stands at an impressive 4.9, a testament to our team's unwavering dedication and expertise.

Feedback is crucial for our growth, and we truly value the insights our customers share on trusted platforms like Trustpilot and MyWOT. It's heartwarming to see our team members' names being mentioned with words of appreciation. This recognition from our customers is the ultimate reward, as it shows our positive impact on their lives.

### AI Chatbots for your assistance

We often get questions about how AI and chatbots fit into our customer support system. While we embrace technology, we've taken a careful approach to finding the right balance. Our Live chat includes a customized bot that efficiently directs users to the right specialist. However, we strongly believe in the importance of human interaction. Our dedicated team members step in to provide personalized assistance beyond what the bot can do. As AI keeps advancing, we're open to exploring its potential integration in the future. But for now, we prioritize live communication with our clients. Building a genuine connection beyond transactions is crucial in today's virtual world.
