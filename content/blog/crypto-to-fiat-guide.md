# Intro

Welcome to the Crypto to Fiat Guide, designed for advertisers who prefer making fiat deposits. This guide outlines the process using a third-party service called Changelly. 

❗ *It's important to note that Changelly is an external platform, and while we provide this guide, we cannot be held responsible for any issues you might encounter while using it. Additionally, we do not offer financial documentation for purchases made through Changelly.*

# Guide

**1. Initiating the Deposit**

To begin, log in to your AADS account and select "Deposit funds."\
💡Let’s say we’d like to deposit BTC

**4. Choosing Fiat and Crypto**

At this point, you need to select the fiat currency you wish to use for payment and the cryptocurrency you're depositing (the same one chosen in the AADS deposit window).

\
💡 For instance, if you're depositing BTC and have copied the BTC address, choose BTC. In this example, we'll be buying BTC in USD.
