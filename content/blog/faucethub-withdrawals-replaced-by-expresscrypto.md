meta_title: FaucetHub withdrawals replaced by ExpressCrypto
meta_description: Attention FaucetHub users! A-ADS has replaced FaucetHub with
  an alternative service, ExpressCrypto, to enable withdrawals of small sums of
  money. To continue withdrawing your funds, please update your withdrawal
  settings and provide your unique ID from ExpressCrypto. With ExpressCrypto,
  there's no withdrawal threshold and a fixed withdrawal fee of 500 satoshis for
  withdrawals to bitcoin addresses. Please note that while we believe
  ExpressCrypto is legitimate, we cannot guarantee the safety of your funds and
  advise you to use it at your own risk.

Since [FaucetHub](https://faucethub.io/) stops maintaining its services, we've replaced it with an alternative service - [ExpressCrypto](https://expresscrypto.io/). Thus our publishers keep the opportunity to withdraw little sums of money.

If you used FaucetHub, please, set new withdrawal settings. You can enable ExpressCrypto withdrawals in your user or ad unit withdrawal settings.

You'll need to sign up at ExpressCrypto and specify your unique ID provided by this service in the corresponding field.

You won't face any withdrawal threshold to withdraw from A-ADS as ExpressCrypto allows 1-satoshi transactions. The withdrawal fee for any withdrawals from ExpressCrypto to bitcoin addresses is fixed and counts 500 satoshis, and there's no withdrawal threshold.

We believe that ExpressCrypto is a legit service, but we can't guarantee the safety of the funds sent to them. Please use it at your own risk!
