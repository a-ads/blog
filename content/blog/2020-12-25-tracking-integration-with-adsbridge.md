* You can change or adjust (if necessary) any option in the New traffic source form. Once you have done so, click the “Save” button. \
  Note: “{{partner}}” should remain in “token 1”.

2. Create an offer. Read the “Creating an Offer” article [here](https://www.adsbridge.com/guide/create-offer/), to learn how to do that.
3. (Optional) Create a Landing page. Watch how to create one [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FLHUU1eyng).
4. Create a campaign in AdsBridge with your earlier created traffic source. If you don't know how to create a campaign in AdsBridge, find out [here](https://www.adsbridge.com/guide/create-campaign/).

**Note**: Use your AdsBridge campaign link as your A-ADS campaign link, without the “?” and everything after.

Also, if you did not create a landing page you can use AdsBridge “direct link”, as seen in the image below:

5. Log into your A-ADS account.
6. Enable Goal tracking for your campaign at A-ADS as seen in the image below, if you don't have a campaign you can create one [here](https://a-ads.com/campaigns/new).

7. Update your A-ADS campaign’s “Goal Tracking” “Suffix” with your AdsBridge’s campaign link, only everything after, and including the “?”, or simply by picking the necessary tokens below the place holder, they will be added to the “suffix”, then save your campaign.
