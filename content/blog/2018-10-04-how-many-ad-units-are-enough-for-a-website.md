If you have several ad units on your webpage, it is most likely that the first one will summon all the unique impressions. With 1 or 2 unique impressions your other ad units will become inactive. This is exactly why we recommend our publishers to make good use of one or two banners per page. You can follow our **rules of ad unit allocation**, make the most out of A-Ads and save more space for other network banners. Remember that our withdrawal threshold is 100,000 satoshi, so having few ad units with more unique impressions will help you to withdraw profits more quickly. 

Honestly, filling the page with ad units will hardly make you richer, but it can severely overload our servers!
