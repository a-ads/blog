## Possible errors and solutions

1. If you don’t have an A-ADS ad unit, this plugin will **not** generate any income for you. You can create one [here](https://a-ads.com/ad_units/new).
2. If you don’t see the banner/text ad, it could simply mean that the selected placeholder doesn’t exist yet, due to your content or type of content. Fix by placing the banner/text ad in a different placeholder.

For instance if you put the ad widget in “Left Sidebar”, and you didn’t see the banner/text ad at the specified placeholder, just place the ad widget in a different placeholder. E.G “Right Sidebar”, or “Footer”, or any other placeholder that exists.

Note: you can drag and drop the ad widget or any other widget to different placeholders.

Also, you can use multiple instances of the widget with different or same ad units configuration on the same or different pages, just by repeating these steps.
