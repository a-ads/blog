A-Ads is the first bitcoin-based advertising network, founded in 2011. We bring you the extensive selection of traffic sources which are perfect for the promotion of ICOs, FinTech crypto-related services, crypto-exchanges and Trading, Cloud Mining, Gaming, Gambling and Blockchain projects. 

**Privacy made easier**.  Your personal data is safe - we simply don’t need it! It takes mere seconds to start your anonymous advertising campaign or create an anonymous advertising unit. We accept major crypto-currencies such as Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Dash, Monero, Litecoin, and Zcash. 

**Exposure made easier**. Here at A-Ads, we believe that global advertising is for everyone. It takes less than a minute to become an advertiser, with only a link to your site! Our self service platform will do the rest, building a teaser and selecting relevant traffic sources automatically, so you don’t have to!

We offer Pay-per-Day (CPD) and Pay-for-Result (CPA + RS) models which you can mix in one campaign, as well as context ads in most popular languages. 

**Earn with us even easier**. Become a publisher, add up to our daily traffic and take your share of the profit straight from the world of cryptocurrency. We support the Acceptable Ads initiative. Our ads are unobtrusive and safe, and they don’t leave cookies. Keep your privacy and enjoy lightning fast ad delivery, thanks to the lack of client-side real-time bidding.
