If you want to become our publisher, the main phrase you need to learn is “unique impressions”. What do we mean by that?

One IP address can generate only 1 impression in the scope of the whole network during a day. This impression will be considered unique as it comes from the visitor who hasn't seen our ads for the past 24 hours. This makes our stats incompatible with Google Analytics or any other web visitors counting services. But here’s the good news: the number of clicks doesn’t matter that much too! And we are not pay-per-impression network either. Your earnings depend not on the absolute amount of unique impressions, but on the share of the network-wide unique impressions that you generate (**and a few other factors as well**)
