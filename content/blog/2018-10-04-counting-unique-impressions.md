If you want to become our publisher, you might be interested to learn what we mean by “unique impressions”.

One IP address can generate only 1 unique impression in the scope of the whole network during a day. This impression will be considered unique as it comes from the visitor who hasn't seen our ads for the past 24 hours.

This makes our stats incompatible with Google Analytics or any other web visitors counting services. 

But here’s the good news: we are not pay-per-impression neither pay-per-click network. Your earnings depend not on the absolute amount of unique impressions, but on the share of the network-wide unique impressions that you generate, on the available advertising budgets and many other factors as well.
