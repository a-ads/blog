The audience is also enriched by customers who speak Chinese, Portuguese, and German.

### Our Publishers' Websites Categories¬†

üìçCategorization is another facet that offers intriguing insights. Let's check the categories of sites our publishers' websites belong to. The entertainment category emerges as the unequivocal favorite, with an impressive 28.9% of advertisers selecting it as the canvas for their promotions. Following closely are the premium categories, comprising 23% of the choices. Adults-only sites carve out a respectable niche, claiming 10.7% of the total types. In our eclectic mix, online earning platforms and crypto-centric websites also shine as popular categories. Meanwhile, Goods and Services command a modest 1.7% share of the advertiser's canvas.
