Podcasts have taken over the world - and that's no exaggeration. There are over four million podcasts and the average person listens to eight podcasts weekly! And this instrument can become your great marketing tool in promoting your business or product.

## What is a podcast?

Podcasting is pretty much similar to radio but much more convenient because the broadcasts are available at any time and on various devices.

The term "podcasting" emerged from journalist Ben Hammersley's 2004 article for The Guardian, blending "iPod" and "broadcasting." Although Apple did not invent podcasts, the iPod was one of the MP3 players for audio file consumption.However, the actual podcasting explosion occurs in the 2020s and gives benefits not only for listeners but also for businesses.

Let's check what a podcast will give your business:

**1. A strong brand**

A podcast can become a platform to discuss your company's values, create a story, and describe a mission. Podcasts can make your customers fall in love with you!

**2. A well-developed corporate culture**

The podcast is the voice of your team, which unites and inspires. This format can firstly please the team and attract new talented employees.

**3. Podcast platforms have their promotion algorithms**

Through a podcast, people can learn about your business. Why buy podcast advertising if you can make your own and get the pluses described above for free? 

## How to Determine if Podcasts are the Right Communication Channel for You?

If you're considering using podcasts as a communication channel, there are a few **factors to consider:**

Firstly, assess whether a podcast complements your brand and its existing ecosystem. It can seamlessly fit into various parts, such as the warm-up or marketing segment. It allows the podcast to become a profound touchpoint with your company or product.

Secondly, if your intended topic hasn't been covered extensively in podcast form yet, it presents a unique opportunity to establish yourself as a leading voice in that domain.

Lastly, consider the networking aspect. A podcast can be a powerful tool for building connections with individuals you might not easily meet for a casual chat over coffee, providing a platform to engage and learn from them.

Now, let’s also check the advantages and disadvantages of podcast format:

## How Marketers Can Use Podcasts

Podcasting is a great additional marketing tool that can:

**Expands a brand's target audience:** People discover podcasts based on their interests or through recommendations, leading them to learn more about the company behind the episodes. As a result, listeners are enticed to visit the company's website, generating new leads.

**Increases loyalty:** Podcasts often show the informal side of a company, which humanizes the brand. Sharing live stories from employees and discussing internal affairs creates a sense of empathy and connection with the audience. Listeners feel a genuine presence during the podcast, leading to a stronger bond between customers and the company.

**Natively promoted:** During the conversation, participants can mention the company's products in the context of other stories and tell their examples and cases. It offers a seamless way to promote a company's products. 

### Types Of Podcasts That Work As Marketing Tools

**1. Company-Branded Podcasts**

 This format represents the company's voice and message. It may either replace traditional brand media or complement existing blogs. These podcasts revolve around topics relevant to the target audience and directly linked to the company's products, covering cases, news, and industry trends.

**2. Partner Podcasts**

In this approach, company experts collaborate with other podcasters on topics related to their brand, creating joint projects or recurring columns. This strategic partnership allows the partner's audience to discover the company's brand while driving additional traffic to the company's website.

**3. Podcast Sponsorship**

Here, the company funds the creation of a podcast project, and, in return, the hosts regularly promote and advertise the brand. One significant advantage of podcast advertising is that the audience tends to be more receptive and loyal to ads than other mediums, like videos. The seamless integration of ads in podcasts ensures listeners are less likely to skip through them, as is often the case with video ads. Moreover, this form of advertising proves beneficial in situations where users may find it inconvenient to engage with visual content, such as while driving and listening to an audio broadcast.

## How To Create A Podcast

**Step1: Choose a Compelling Topic**

 Select a topic that aligns with your brand and product but goes beyond mere advertising. Consider offering valuable content that benefits your audience. For instance, if you sell fitness apparel, your podcast could feature interviews with trainers, nutritionists, and other experts, discussing sports and healthy eating. It's essential to narrow down the focus and be specific about the subject matter.

**Step 2. Determine the Format and Create an Outline**

Decide on the podcast's format, whether it will be a classic interview style, a single-narrator show, or perhaps a captivating audio series with a detective theme and music. Create an outline that includes the number of episodes and the names of potential guests. Decide if you'll include welcome music and sound effects. Consistency is vital, so consider whether your podcast will have a limited number of episodes, be organized by seasons, or have regular releases every week or month.

**Step 3. Write a Script** 

Preparation is key, even in live conversations. A script or a structured plan on how the conversation will be moderated ensures a smoother flow and engaging content. If your podcast follows a narrative format like a TV series, precise scripting becomes even more important.

**Step 4. Record the Episodes** 

The recording process depends on available resources and capabilities. If participants are in different locations, remote recording through calls is acceptable. Some podcasters prefer recording in professional studios with high-quality microphones in a quiet environment. In the beginning, even a basic dictaphone can suffice.

**Step 5. Edit and Enhance Audio Quality**

A well-edited audio file is crucial for maintaining audience interest. Clean the recording by removing pauses, sighs, background noises, and speaker filler words. Ensure the audio is pleasant to listen to. Use editing software like Audacity to fine-tune the episodes. You can also add a jingle or short audio intro to give your podcast a unique identity. Free resources or self-recorded music can serve as suitable options.

**Step 6. Publish on Podcast Platforms**

To reach a broader audience, upload your podcast to a website or a dedicated podcast hosting platform that utilizes RSS technology. This will automatically distribute your episodes to various podcasting platforms. Make sure to include engaging podcast covers and compelling descriptions. Popular podcast platforms such as Apple, Google, Castbox, and SoundCloud are great places to share your content.

## How to Promote Your Podcast

Consistency is key when it comes to podcasting. Regularly posting new episodes will keep your activity visible to platform users. Establish a schedule for releasing new broadcasts, whether it's once a week, every two weeks, or any other frequency that works for you.

Here are some effective promotion methods:

**1. Use Podcast Platforms:** Take advantage of podcast platforms that highlight new and interesting broadcasts. Familiarize yourself with each platform's rules and guidelines. Some may offer advertising options, while others may require you to demonstrate why your podcast deserves attention.

**2. Use Social Media:** Promote your podcast on various social media platforms. Share the podcast link on both your personal and brand accounts. Encourage your audience to listen, rate, and share the episodes. Social media advertising can also be a powerful tool to boost the visibility of your podcast and reach a broader audience.

**3. Engage with Media Outlets:** Reach out to relevant publications and media outlets that align with your podcast's topic and your business. If your podcast interests the editors, they may feature your podcast and talk about it, providing valuable exposure free of charge.

### Popular Podcasts Formats 

The **"People Talk"** format includes:

1. Guest Podcasts (Interviews): These episodes feature guest interviews, providing diverse perspectives and insights on specific topics.
2. Regular Hosts Discussing Topics: In this format, two, three, or more hosts engage in conversations about particular subjects, offering their viewpoints and opinions.
3. News Podcasts:This format focuses on delivering news content, keeping listeners informed about current events and trending topics.
4. Reality Shows:Similar to reality TV, reality shows in podcast form involve real-life scenarios, interactions, and experiences.

The **"People Tell Stories"** format encompasses two subtypes:

1. Narrative Podcast: Each episode is intricately connected to the previous one, creating a continuous storyline akin to a TV series. Crafting a compelling narrative requires a skilled editor and copywriter who can weave an engaging and captivating story from the podcast's content.
2. Single-Host Storytelling: In this style, the host narrates a standalone story in each episode, providing the audience with a unique and self-contained experience.
