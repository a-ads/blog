Digital marketing is changing from year to year, and sometimes it is hard to predict where it will develop next. This article will explore the possible trends of 2023 that can help you attract new customers and bring more profit. 

1. A.I. for Digital Marketing

Artificial intelligence has entered the list of digital marketing trends in recent years. According to statistics, 54% of business owners and executives that had implemented A.I. have noticed better workplace productivity. About 40% of all companies are sure that it is essential to monitor the quality of service so that customers are always satisfied.

Even if a company is not directly integrating AI-based elements, many applications and programs already include machine learning, such as Google Ads, Facebook I.Q., and bots in messengers for CRM.

There are at least three ways how A.I. can improve personalization:

* Paid advertising where A.I. helps to automate the process. This includes increasing the number of qualified leads, improving brand or product/service awareness, and maximising conversions.
* All sorts of advertisements. Many CRM platforms use predictive analytics to help companies automate the emailing period based on the browsing history of site pages.
* Content marketing, where collected data helps to create engaging content that attracts traffic.

2. Voice Assistants and Bots

Chatbots and other types of assistants will gain more and more popularity in 2023. They are effective not only for clients but also for companies. The most popular option in retail is customer service, where A.I. helps predict customer behaviour and creates hyper-personalization. Since 2020, many marketers have started implementing chatbots for user experience strategies. Business executives have noticed improved communication with customers through the introduction of digital technologies.

The main advantages of such assistants are:

* 24/7 service
* Instant answers to questions

In 2023, the trend will continue to grow, analyse consumers behaviour, and improve communication with them.

3. Using the Customer Data Platform (CDP)

[CDP](https://www.oracle.com/cx/customer-data-platform/what-is-cdp/) is a marketing technology that aggregates customer data from multiple sources and then makes it available to other applications. Using this technology, a business can combine all its data from sales to marketing and synchronise to create a customised omnichannel experience.

By implementing CDP, you will receive a single database that stores all necessary information about your customers. This technology not only collects but also analyses data from all possible sources, thanks to which it can make recommendations and offer a view of each client. 

4. Personalization

Users who view two product pages on your site spend twice as much on average as those who only view one (according to Dynamic Yield). A McKinsey study also showed that personalization revenue growth could be up to 25%.

You should pay particular attention to the interests and behaviour patterns of generation Z. This is the generation of digital natives, and these guys aged 17-25 determine and set the trends of many industries. They like innovative technical solutions and dynamic visual formats, and they need to be guided by this.

5. Data Security 

In 2022, users paid more attention to how brands use their data. In 2023, this trend will most likely continue. For a business, it means discussing how you plan to use the information and strengthening the protection of sites and applications from hacking. 

35% of customers will forget about a brand if it secretly collects their data and uses it for recommendations, so broadcast your concern to customers, increasing loyalty and attracting a new audience. For example, Google is preparing to drop cookies in favour of the Privacy Sandbox project, which speaks to growing concerns about the security and ethics of data access.

6. Effective UX

The importance of a convenient mobile version or application of your project is critical as the number of people accessing the Internet from a smartphone was 5.31 billion in 2022 compared with 5.19 billion in 2020. 

So, carefully ensure that your site is optimised and fast-loaded, autocomplete fields work correctly, and design elements are conveniently located. The On3 agency analysed the results of companies from UX updates and found that 37% of brands increased revenue due to thoughtful UX design.

Plus, websites and applications should be developed with the ability to use animation formats and short videos. The ability to convey important information in small portions and with dynamics will be key in the fight for the audience's attention, which is especially important in the mobile version.

Many global brands are already using short formats in the UX design of their main and product pages. For example, the [Apple Music](https://www.apple.com/apple-music/) homepage has a cool scrolling animation that helps diversify the experience. 

7. Live Broadcasts

Live videos are viral among consumers, with people spending three times much more time watching live streams as they watch pre-recorded videos.

Such content is one of the most popular ways for customers to learn about new products. Adding a live element makes the video more engaging as the audience feels like they are a part of it and can influence the content rather than passively watching.

8. Account Based Marketing

Account-based marketing strategy helps to personalise the messaging process with businesses. It gives each decision-maker the information they need to solve specific problems. In a nutshell, it knows what information is necessary precisely for a particular person. 

Like personalised direct-to-customer messaging, account-based marketing delivers a higher ROI. It is one of the "already existing" digital marketing trends that will be relevant in the coming years.

9. Moderate Push Notifications

61% of businesses name push notifications the most effective way to motivate customers to buy. Using this tool, you can increase revenue by 25-95%, depending on the industry. At the same time, it should not be abused - studies show that if you send more than ten daily notifications, 3 to 7% of customers will unsubscribe from you daily.

10. Voice Search

According to Apple, the daily audience of Siri's voice assistant is 500 million users, and people communicate with her mainly by voice. For the site to be better found by conversational queries, you need to be more attentive to SEO optimization: check the content for originality, regularly update the site and monitor current queries. 

11. Growth in Emerging Markets

Emerging markets in Asia have grown significantly over the past decade and are expected to continue to grow over the next ten years. The global consumer pool will be replenished with more than a billion new customers from China, India, and Indonesia. Companies looking to scale up their marketing efforts and reach new consumers must think carefully about how best to get them in 2023.

12. Customer Journey Tracking

Whether you're in a B2B or B2C market, tracking the buyer's journey with a simple linear approach is no longer possible. Consumers come to you from many different sources, and with marketing automation software, you can start to map and understand those paths. It allows:

These 12 trends will likely see growth this year. However, they are not the only trends that play significant importance in market development. Some trends live a couple of months, while others evolve and stay with us for a long time. We will keep an eye on them and tell you about new trends and strategies soon.
