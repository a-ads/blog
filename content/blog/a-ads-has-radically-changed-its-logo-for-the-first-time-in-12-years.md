The rebranding features a simple company name inscription with an 'A' in a circle instead of the well-known mustache icon.

The original A-ADS logo debuted in 2011 alongside the network's launch, emphasizing anonymity as the primary value proposition. Hence, the logo depicted "Mr. Anonymity," aligning with the company's full name, Anonymous Ads. 

Over the years, the logo underwent minor changes in color and font. Below, you can compare the two A-ADS logos.

"We recognize that customer preferences have evolved since our company's inception. Anonymity is no longer the primary value; customers now prioritize receiving a quality product. Advertisers seek a reliable platform with quality traffic and convenient targeting to reach their target audience. Publishers value the earnings potential from our network, as well as the quality and formats of ads displayed on their websites. We have long been working to enhance these aspects within our network. We believe it's time to let customers know that anonymity is not our sole advantage and to shift the focus away from it in our logo and name," commented an A-ADS marketer.

Now, the logo emphasizes the first letter A, which encompasses several meanings characterizing the company: it might be Alternative, Artificial, Augmented, Advanced, Automated, still Anonymous and some other connotations. 

"We don't want to limit ourselves by choosing just one meaning, because A-ADS is really so much more. We're not just an advertising network. We provide publishers with the opportunity to attract new advertisers to their site, earning by bringing advertisers into the network. We also offer an automated service for publishers to manage advertising and provide manual ad moderation when necessary. In other words, we offer more services and opportunities than the typical advertising network," continues the marketer.

It was also decided to encircle the first letter A, considering how people are subconsciously accustomed to processing information. In our everyday lives, A stands for an excellent grade; it's the first letter of the alphabet, closely associated with being number one. Number one in the market.

Additionally, the 'A' references the unique technology embedded in A-ADS banners, referred to as the "Advertise here" feature within the company. This feature allows advertisers to quickly set up ad campaigns targeting the website where the banner is placed or any other site or category of sites by clicking on a link in the banner. Therefore, this feature now has a justified icon in the form of the first letter of the feature name.

“Recently, we have been actively working on several new features for publishers and advertisers, as well as on the visuals of our interfaces. Let the logo change signify and mark the beginning of the major changes in the product that we eagerly anticipate,” - commented A-ADS.
