The rebranding features a simple company name inscription with an 'A' in a circle instead of the well-known mustache icon. Also, the company's name no longer contains a hyphen and has become one character shorter - AADS.

The company's first logo appeared in 2011 and looked quite different from what most clients are used to seeing. The company's previous full name was Anonymous Ads, and it helped two anonymous parties — advertisers and publishers — find each other. The logo depicted two characters wearing masks. And if you look closely, you can see the letters "A" in the characters, representing the first letters of the company's name.

Later, in 2013, the logo was updated to the version that represented the company up until this year. This logo also emphasized anonymity as an important product value, but now in the form of “Mr. Anonymity” with a mustache.

"The larger our client base grew, the more we began to understand what customers wanted to see in the product beyond the ability to remain anonymous. Advertisers seek a reliable platform with quality traffic and convenient targeting to reach their target audience. Publishers value the earnings potential from our network, as well as the quality and formats of ads displayed on their websites. We have long been working to enhance these aspects within our network. We believe it’s time to stop emphasizing anonymity in the company's name and logo, as our advertising network offers many other advantages as well," commented an AADS marketer.\
Now, the logo emphasizes the first letter A, which encompasses several meanings characterizing the company: it might be Alternative, Artificial, Augmented, Advanced, Automated, still Anonymous and some other even quite rebellious connotations. 

"We don't want to limit ourselves by choosing just one meaning, because AADS is really so much more. We're not just an advertising network. We provide publishers with the opportunity to attract new advertisers to their site, earning by bringing advertisers into the network. We also offer an automated service for publishers to manage advertising and provide manual ad moderation when necessary. In other words, we offer more services and opportunities than the typical advertising network," continues the marketer.

It was also decided to encircle the first letter A, considering how people are subconsciously accustomed to processing information. In our everyday lives, A stands for an excellent grade; it's the first letter of the alphabet, closely associated with being number one. Number one in the market.\
Additionally, the 'A' references the unique technology embedded in AADS banners, referred to as the "Advertise here" feature within the company. This feature allows advertisers to quickly set up ad campaigns targeting the website where the banner is placed or any other site or category of sites by clicking on a link in the banner. Therefore, this feature now has a justified icon in the form of the first letter of the feature name.

Why has the name of the advertising network changed?

"In addition to changing the logo, we have shortened our name by removing the hyphen and fully merging the characters into one entity. Now we are not A-ADS, but AADS. This also changed our domain name (now aads.com). Thus, we have become even closer to our clients, now it will be even easier to find and remember us," comments at AADS.
