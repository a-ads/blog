1. **Make them accessible to our bot**. This means no pop-up questions or private zones that need authorization. Ad unit should be embedded statically  (i.e. in the source code of a web page) and the URL should be exactly the same as you specify in the ad unit information.

2. **Add our bot IP address to your whitelist**. If you use cloudflare or other anti-DDoS service, make sure our bot IP is added to the whitelist. You can ask the support team for the IP address.

3. **Place the code on the exact URL within a single domain name**\
Thereâ€™s no problem in using the same code for the whole domain. But you must follow certain rules: embed the code statically, exactly on the assigned URL and make the page generally accessible. Using the same ad unit for several domains is not possible.
