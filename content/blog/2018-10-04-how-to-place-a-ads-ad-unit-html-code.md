## **Embed ad unit code on the specified URL**

Thereâ€™s no problem in using the same code for the whole domain and its subdomains. But you must embed the code on the assigned URL and make the page generally accessible. If you want to use other domains, please create separate ad units.

## **Make ad units accessible to our bot**

This means no pop-up questions or private zones that need authorization. Ad unit should be visible and clickable. If you use Cloudflare or another anti-DDoS service, you might need to add exceptions for the assigned URL or whitelist our bot (contact support for details).
