First of all, let's figure out what DeFi stands for. DeFi means decentralized finance, opposite TradFi, which is well-known traditional finance. Thanks to Web 3.0 technology, DeFi gained its crazy popularity within just several years and continues to take over the financial world. In just five years, the total value locked (TVL) in DeFi increased from 0 to 55 billion dollars, reaching its peak in November 2021 with $106B!  

We have already written a helpful guide on how DeFi works, which you can find in our article ["What is DeFi? How Does DeFi Work?"](https://a-ads.com/blog/what-is-defi-how-does-it-work/)

So, what is the primary goal of DeFi? We all know that the crypto market is highly volatile, so DeFi provides investors more stability. 

The purpose of DeFi is to decrease the risks and find the balance between volatility and return. Crypto projects can offer enormous yields, sometimes hundreds and thousands %. But no one is sure that investors will not lose all their money within a second. That's where DeFi helps to eliminate the risk of losing everything at once. As for the profit, the historical rate of return for DeFi investments has been around 5-20%. These facts make DeFi so appealing to crypto investors.

In this article, you will learn how to start investing in DeFi crypto and how to use DeFi. We will also look closely at the best DeFi tokens to buy. 

## How to Invest in De-Fi

The main benefit of DeFi is that it eliminates the need for intermediaries such as a physical bank location, staff, or long and inefficient bank transfers. 

If you eliminate these costs, users can get more benefits with DeFi than a traditional financial system can offer. Savings account interest rates on DeFi products are over ten times more lucrative than conventional banks. If you choose to use stablecoins, you avoid volatile crypto markets.

So, how to start investing in DeFi? 

### Step 1. Prepare a Wallet

Your crypto wallet is like a regular wallet where you store the crypto coins you'll use to participate in DeFi protocols. The difference is that this wallet is digital. So, first, choose the wallet you like. Overall, all wallets can be divided into two types: custodial and non-custodial. Non-custodial means that no one manages your crypto on your behalf. 

Before choosing one, think about such factors as accessibility and compatibility. For example, hot wallets, which are software-based, are easy to use and have high accessibility. But some people consider them less secure. At the same time, cold wallets are hardware wallets. They are a separate mechanism designed to protect crypto assets from cyber attacks. They are often expensive and less convenient to use. How to choose a good wallet for your needs we have written here.(Ссылка на статью в декабре 5 Best Crypto Wallets of 2022) 

### Step 2. Purchase Crypto Coins

Now you need crypto coins to participate in DeFi protocols. Most popular wallets can be connected to exchanges where you can purchase DeFi coins. Obtain a DeFi token by visiting the protocol's website and linking your wallet to buy native coins. Then you can invest in the pool of your choice on the platform. 

### Step 3. Get Started With Protocols

All the major protocols are based on Ethereum, meaning that you can lend or borrow any ERC20 token. The Protocols make it possible for investors to trade or stake (or lock up) crypto for a reward. You can also participate in liquidity pools to receive some earnings as a reward when transactions are made in your pools. Plus, you can be engaged in yield farming, giving someone a loan and earning some interest.

**ERC20 is a standard or set of rules that make it easier for contracts to interact.**

So when dealing with protocols, you need to visit the protocol's website or app, then connect your wallet so that their platform can access your crypto coins, and follow their instructions to start trading, yield farming, or whatever you want. 

### Step 4. Track Your DeFi Investments

And the final step is to track your investments. Yep, just that. 

## How to Use DeFi

The best way to understand how to use DeFi is to learn it in practice. Let's use one of the most popular DeFi platforms, such as Uniswap.

I will show you how to perform a simple ETH exchange for DAI, a decentralized stablecoin. 

First, I will send my ETH, which I have already purchased from Binance to Uniswap. To do so, I need to connect my wallet. I go on Uniswap and click "Connect to a wallet" on the top right of the site (through a desktop browser). I will use MetaMask, a popular browser wallet compatible with most DeFi applications.

Then, click MetaMask.

After that, you will see your wallet address in MetaMask. So, you'll need to send some Ethereum to that MetaMask address from wherever you're holding your ETH. I Use Binance, so I will send $5 for the beginning to MetaMask. Remember about the transaction fee. The transaction can take several minutes to arrive at your MetaMask address.

In the next stage, I have to pay a small fee to liquidity providers. Now, let's exchange 0.0001 ETH for 0.117 DAI. Click on the swap, then select ETH and DAI from the list. Then click swap and open up your MetaMask address. Wait until the transaction is submitted.

Then I have to wait a bit for the validation from Ethereum miners, and finally, that's it! 

Now let's talk about the best DeFi tokens to invest in. 

## Best DeFi Tokens to Invest in

Choosing the best DeFi tokens is difficult, as plenty of them are released regularly. Before choosing one, you should carefully check the token's utilities, fees, current market capitalization, objectives and road map targets, and ease of use. After considering these metrics, I've picked up several good DeFi tokens for you to choose from:

1. Meta Master Guild (MMG) 

MMG is an excellent option for gamers to earn while playing. The platform is nearly finished and is at its presale stage. Now you can buy the tokens for a reasonable price of $0.01 USDT per token. 

While you play, the platform rewards its players with "Gems," the in-game currency within MMG. They, in turn, can be converted into the platform's native token, $MEMAG. And here, you can choose whether to spend this money within the ecosystem or convert it into real-world money. 

2. DeFi Coin (DEFC) 

DeFi Coin has been named one of the best-performing digital currencies. What makes it so unique? DeFi Coin is a cryptocurrency token firmly ingrained within the ever-growing decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. Being a native token of the DeFi Swap exchange, this coin gives its users plenty of opportunities to swap and stake various DeFi tokens easily. You must connect your wallet to the DeFi Swap platform and choose which two tokens you want to convert. All transactions are secured. 

You can earn rewards in DEFC tokens through a "static rewards" process. In a nutshell, it means that when a user sells or swaps their DeFi Coin holdings, a 10% tax is held from this transaction. Then, 50% of this tax is distributed proportionately among the current token holders. That's not all. Later, 50% is redistributed into the liquidity pools of DeFi Swap. This redistribution helps to prevent volatility. 

DeFi Swap plans to develop its ecosystem and take care of new investors by creating educational tutorials and materials for further usage.

3. Lucky Block

It is the next superb option to consider buying. The Lucky Block project, launched in 2021, uses blockchain protocols to provide a play-to-earn and prize draw platform. This coin became one of the best-performing digital assets of the year. The token is supported on Pancakeswap - one of the largest Decentralised exchanges (DEXs) in the DeFi sector. After being made available with an ICO of $0.00089, LBLOCK skyrocketed to $0.009617 - giving users more than a 10x price increase.

At the center of this ecosystem is LBLOCK - the native digital token. By holding LBLOCK tokens, users can buy tickets without paying any transaction fee and receive instant payouts on daily jackpot rewards.

Lucky Block is trading at only $0.0009 per token and has excellent potential to grow in the future. 

4. Optimism (OP)

Optimism even sounds optimistic, being one of the most highly anticipated Layer 2 networks for Ethereum. OP stands out from the crowd as it can deliver a vastly improved user experience for decentralized applications (dApps) in the ecosystem.

One of the main advantages of Optimism is that it can process a massive number of transactions at a low cost, being pretty secure simultaneously.

Optimism ecosystems include NFT tools, decentralized exchanges, cross-chain bridges, and various trading tools. 

5. Decentraland

The market cap of Decentraland is around $1.3 billion, and this crypto project is considered one of the best MetaVerse coins in 2022. 

In a nutshell, Decentraland is built on top of the Ethereum blockchain that offers virtual gaming. One of the most innovative things about Decentraland is that users can buy virtual land using MANA - a native token of Decentraland - and subsequently build digital real estate. Plus, users can receive and earn rewards on the platform through MANA. 

MANA has corrected from an all-time high (ATH) of $5.90 to less than $1 as of May 2022. However, the ROI (from the time of launch) is still at an impressive 2749%, according to Coinmarketcap.

 6. Cosmos (ATOM)

Cosmos is a unique project with a market cap of around $1 billion. 

The Cosmos network tries to solve the blockchain interoperability problem- a process allowing multiple blockchains to interact with one another. Cosmos has a protocol that helps compete for blockchains to communicate with each other. It would enable Bitcoin, for example, to share and extract data from the Ethereum blockchain – and vice versa. 

This outstanding solution made ATOM the 30th largest cryptocurrency on the market. It's currently trading at $9.41, which is approximately a 46% ROI from the time of the initial token release.

7. SushiSwap 

Ignore its funny name because SUSHI has a market cap of $325 million and provides high levels of liquidity to users. 

SushiSwap is an automated market maker (AMM) that creates an automatic algorithm to provide liquidity between multiple DeFi tokens in an utterly decentralized manner. It is also built on the Ethereum chain, and users can trade ERC-20 tokens on SushiSwap through liquidity pools. SushiSwap also provides interest-earning options on its NFT marketplaces and yield farming. 

You also don't need an account to use SushiSwap, and being a governance token, SushiSwap gives its holders voting rights. If you buy SushiSwap, you can vote on proposals and help determine what happens with it.
