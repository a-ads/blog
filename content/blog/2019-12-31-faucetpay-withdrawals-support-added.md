We have implemented the support of <a href="https://faucetpay.io/" rel="nofollow">FaucetPay</a> withdrawals. FaucetPay is a micro-wallet service alternative to  <a href="https://expresscrypto.io/" rel="nofollow">ExpressCrypto</a>. So now you can choose between these two.

To use the new withdrawal option, please register at FaucetPay and link your bitcoin address to the service. After this, you can configure FaucetPay withdrawal on the "Finances -> Withdrawal options" page.

Although we believe that FaucetPay is a legit service, we cannot guarantee the safety of your funds there. 

We hope the new withdrawal opportunity will make our service handier. Happy New Year!
