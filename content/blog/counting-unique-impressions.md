If you are our client or just think to become one, you might be interested to learn what we mean by "globally unique impressions" (guImpressions), "globally unique clicks" (guClicks) and "globally unique CPM" (guCPM).

**G﻿lobally unique impression (guImpressions)**

* One IP address can generate only 1 globally unique impression in the scope of the whole network during a day. This impression will be considered globally unique as it comes from a visitor who hasn't seen our ads for the past 24 hours. And this visitor won't generate another globally unique impression during this day, no matter what sites he visits and what ads he sees.
* If there are several ad units on one page, only one of them will receive a globally unique impression upon page load (the one which loads first).
* Also, if your ad unit is of type "Site", then only impressions that go from the site domain or its subdomains will be considered globally unique.

This makes our stats incompatible with Google Analytics or any other web visitors counting services. Our numbers will always be less for the same traffic.

But here’s the good news: we are neither a pay-per-impression nor a pay-per-click network. Your earnings depend not on the absolute amount of globally unique impressions, but on the share of the network-wide globally unique impressions that you generate. So absolute numbers don't mean much.

**G﻿lobally unique clicks (guClicks)**

One IP address can generate only 1 globally unique click in the scope of the whole network during 24 hours. And this visitor won't generate another globally unique click during this day, no matter what ads and on what sites he clicks. C﻿ounting **guCPC** (globally unique CPC), we consider cost per globally unique click.

**G﻿lobally unique CPM (guCPM)**

C﻿ounting guCPM, we consider cost per mille of globally unique impressions. That is why guCPM is higher than standard CPM when all impressions are counted.
