We are thrilled to announce that our partner, **Plasma 8 agency**, is holding **Tbilisi Gaming Fest in Georgia** on **September 15, 2023.** Tbilisi Gaming Fest and Batumi Gaming Fest are two esteemed occasions for exploring business and investment opportunities in Georgia's realm of land-based and online casino operations. 

The festival will be held in Tbilisi at the premises of **The Biltmore Hotel on September 15.** The gathering, set to bring together both local and international enterprises, is designated as the ideal platform for experts, industry stakeholders, and policymakers to share their knowledge and forge new alliances. 

This event has an extraordinary format: a combination of a conference, a demo zone, and a series of entertainment events. 



**Business Event Sections**

• Government & Regulators

 • Investors & Business Owners

 • Operators & Managers

 • Equipment & Software Producers

 • Legal Experts

 • Affiliates, Junket, Tourism & Marketing Agents

 • Payment Systems & Crypto

 • Real Estate Developers

\
The event is supported by local and international industry leaders: **Grand Bellagio** Casino Tbilisi is the general partner of the festival, and **IGT**, a New York-listed global producer of slot machines and games, is the main sponsor. 

The festival will consist of two major parts: a conference, during which the industry leaders will share their experiences on various topics, and a demo zone, which will include casino equipment producers, software developers, gaming-related service companies, operators, and platform providers, as well as real estate developers offering business areas for gaming operations.

Another bonus is that Tbilisi exudes an alluring charm during September, thus meriting a few vacation days. In light of the surge in tourism pursuits, coupled with the swift evolution of the Georgian gaming fraternity, Tbilisi Gaming Fest commands attendance from within the industry's fold.
