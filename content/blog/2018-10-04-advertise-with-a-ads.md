# Relevant traffic

In A-ADS you get to choose the ad units straight from the publishers. Most of our traffic is bitcoin and cryptocurrency-related, but we also feature ICO, bitcoin-casinos, earning online announcements and many more topics from other categories that you can explore in our [catalog](https://a-ads.com/catalog). 

# Pay as much as you like

Default advertising strategy at A-ADS is CPD (cost per day): you set a daily budget and we give you a share of the traffic from ad units which satisfy your targeting criteria.

We can work on CPM (cost per mille) and CPA (cost per action / revenue sharing) basis too, but CPD is preferable because it is simple and you don't need to pay for fake impressions.

# Fine-tune your campaign

Our targeting options include targeting by country, type of ad (text/banner), quality range, traffic sources, max CPM, etc. Each setting comes with its own limitations and may affect the efficiency of your campaign in an unexpected manner.

That is why the recommended way of using A-ADS is the following:

1. Create a low-budget advertising campaign with wide targeting (e. g. target all traffic sources).
2. Enable goal tracking and use your analytics to detect which ad units generate useful traffic and attract customers.
3. Reward efficient traffic sources to get more traffic from them.

You can automate this process via our API, please see the related articles or consult with our support team for details.
