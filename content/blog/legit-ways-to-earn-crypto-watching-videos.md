## Legit Ways to Earn Crypto Watching Videos

Crypto is a rapidly changing world, and new opportunities often appear. And the question of how to earn crypto is still appealing to many.    

This article will browse some real opportunities to earn not a fortune but some coins in your wallet by watching videos. 

Those videos are usually ads, but some exciting projects also go beyond advertising.

Before we start, let's figure out which cryptocurrency-earning apps we can call reliable. I would name three main characteristics:

* The app pays are reliable
* The app/platform interface is easy to use
* The earnings are good

Keeping these three features in mind, let's see what we can find:

1. Coinbase Learning Center 

The [Coinbase Learning Center](https://www.coinbase.com/learn) is well-known for its beginner guides and practical tutorials. Another critical aspect of their platform is the opportunity to earn crypto by learning about individual cryptocurrencies through their course videos.

The algorithm is simple:

1. You choose the course you like 
2. Then watch the videos 
3. Take a quiz after the video 
4. Get your free crypto into the Coinbase wallet

2.  CoinTube App3

CoinTube App by CoinTelegraph is available on the App Store and Google Play. CoinTelegraph rewards users with 10,000 satoshi (or more) worth of bitcoin when they confirm their email addresses.

3. Coinstar 

Another way to earn free cryptocurrency is by using Coinstar.

Coinstar is a free Android app that allows you to earn free cryptocurrency by watching a video for up to 10,000 satoshi daily.

Coinmarketcap has various videos and requires users to take a short quiz afterward, but to tell the truth, the payouts and educational value are also high. 

The platform offers to learn more about PlasmaFinance, FIO Protocol, 1inch, Orchid, and dozens of others. As you go through these, see which tokens you think have the most potential.

5. PlayNano Online

The [platform](https://playnano.online/watch-and-learn) selects around ten random videos and exciting facts about Nano Currency. The users need to start watching the selection of videos that explain in more detail what Nano is and what they can do with Nano.

Quick topics and facts about Nano Currency accompany each video. The users need to answer follow-up questions or take a quiz to check how much they remember. 

The platform is user-friendly and easy to use.

## What you should know about earning cryptocurrency by watching videos

Before diving into watch-and-earn videos,you should know that it isn't a smooth landscape yet. Most of the rewards are pretty low, and you are still subject to the whims of the crypto market. 

These options described in the article are among the best on the market now, but you should still research, know what cryptocurrencies you think have the best chance to succeed, and spend time watching videos that let you earn those currencies.

## Other ways to earn free crypto

Let's have a look at two more apps and platforms to earn free cryptocurrency: 

1. Earncrypto.com

Earncrypto is a free Android app that offers you to earn free cryptocurrency by watching. It rewards users with 10,000 satoshi daily. It also gives bonuses for inviting friends.

2. Mcontent 

This is the world's first watch to earn a digital content platform. The main idea of the platform is to seed funding and incubate and curate filmmakers and content producers worldwide. 

The MContent platform provides users with the opportunity to earn tokens for viewing and uploading content as well as to do some other tasks on the platform. The MContent platform comes with a Wallet connect feature, which allows users to transfer all the tokens they earn on the platform to any BSC Wallet available online.

However, some customers complain about the user interface, which should be more user-friendly.

6. Or get $100 worth of SocialGood Crypto through the Miles App (but for U.S. Users Only)
