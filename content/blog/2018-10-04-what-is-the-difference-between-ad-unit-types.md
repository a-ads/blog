Most of our ad units have "site" type. They are for banners built into site code and shown at sites. We can check the quality of traffic that's generated by these ad units, so they normally earn more if they pass quality check.

"App" type is for ad units that you want to place somewhere else: mobile applications, browser extensions, etc. We cannot check the quality of such traffic, so it shows as anonymous traffic in our system. These ad units usually earn less.  

"Affiliate" type is for ad units, that are not supposed to show advertisements. They exist only as an account in our network and are used to give affiliate links and earn fees from campaigns created with these links. Imagine you don't have a site, you don't have neither a mobile app, nor a browser extension, but you've got a neighbor who needs advertising. You create an affiliate ad unit, give your neighbor a link, he creates a campaign and you get 10% of his fees. 

Don’t worry, ‘“site" and "app" ad units also can be used to create affiliate links.
