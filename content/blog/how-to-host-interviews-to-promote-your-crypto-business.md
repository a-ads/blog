*'I Never Learned Anything While I Was Talking' - Larry King*

In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrencies, making your crypto business stand out is super important. That's where hosting interviews comes in – it's like a secret weapon to get noticed and trusted.

This article shows you how to use interviews for your crypto business. It doesn't matter if you're a newbie  on the block or a crypto pro – we have tips to help you make interviews work wonders for your business.

We'll cover everything from picking the right people to chat with to ensuring your questions are super interesting.  By the time you're done reading, you'll be armed with the know-how to interview your crypto business's best friend.

## Types of Interviews 

Let's check on the various types of interviews that can help you share your insights and connect with your audience.

* **Informational Interview**

Imagine you want to share breaking news about your crypto venture. An informational interview is like a spotlight on the latest happenings. You chat with someone who was right there when it all unfolded or an expert in the field. The goal? To bring out the cold, hard facts fairly and accurately.

* **Analytical Interview**

Ever thought about discussing big issues facing the crypto world? An analytical interview lets you dig deep into important matters. You talk with experts, hash out complex ideas, and explore different viewpoints. It's like dissecting a puzzle with multiple pieces. More voices mean a richer conversation, but watch out for passionate disagreements that can become heated debates.

* **Portrait Interview**

Imagine getting to chat with a well-known figure in the crypto space. A portrait interview is your chance to showcase your journey and achievements. Think of it as introducing them to their fans. Instead of diving into specific topics, the focus is on showing who they are behind the scenes.

* **Blitz Survey**

Sometimes, you only need a quick snapshot of opinions. A blitz survey is like a lightning round of 2-3 questions. This type pops up in news about politics, culture, or sports. After a crypto conference, for example, you might catch a few top figures for a rapid-fire Q&A.

* **Mass Blitz Interview**

Want to know what the crowd thinks? A mass blitz interview is like taking a quick poll from many folks. You ask similar questions to many people, often those just passing by or at an event. It helps you gauge how the public reacts to your crypto endeavors.

* **Free Conversation**

Imagine having an informal chat with a well-known crypto figure. This type of interview is like having coffee with a friend. You discuss whatever comes up, from daily life to personal insights. Only seasoned pros can smoothly steer the conversation while getting honest and unscripted responses.

* **Investigative Journalism**

Suppose you're investigating something big in the crypto world. This interview requires careful prep. You aim to uncover hidden facts that shed light on a specific issue. 

## How to Make your Interview Work 

![How to Make your Interview Work](/blog/assets/как-интервью-помогает-развивать-бизнес-и-привлекает-внимание-к-проекту.png "How to Make your Interview Work")

Let's break down the key elements that make for a great interview:

* **Interview Preparation**

Getting ready is half the battle. Before the interview, research the person you'll speak with or the topic you'll cover. This way, you'll come across as informed and respectful. Plus, it helps you create thoughtful questions that keep the conversation flowing.

* **Open-Ended Questions**

Imagine you're asking questions that can't be answered with a simple "yes" or "no." These questions encourage the interviewee to share more details and insights. They open the door to a rich and engaging conversation. Instead of asking, "Did you enjoy the conference?" you might ask, "What stood out to you the most at the conference?"

* **Aim for Emotion**

People remember feelings more than facts. When you're interviewing, try to tap into emotions. Ask about experiences that made them excited, frustrated, or passionate. This makes the conversation more interesting and helps your audience connect on a deeper level.

* **Emotional Recording**

As you chat, pay attention to the emotions coming through. If your interviewee expresses excitement, curiosity, or concern, ensure those emotions come through in your recording. Emotions add a layer of authenticity and relatability that can make your interview stand out.

* **Achieving Your Interview Goals**

Every interview has a purpose. It could be to inform, entertain, or inspire. Keep your goals in mind as you steer the conversation. If you aim to educate your audience about a new crypto trend, ensure the interview covers the necessary details. If you aim for a heartwarming story, guide the conversation toward those touching moments.

### How to Approach Influencers for Your Interview

![Write Influencers For Your Interview](/blog/assets/письмо.png "Write Influencers For Your Interview")

So, now let's discuss how to reach out to the influencer you want to interview. This can feel a bit tricky, like trying to crack a secret code. You're emailing someone you might not know well, asking them to team up with you.

The trick is to keep your email **short and informative**. Busy folks don't have time to read long emails. Plus, you want to prove you're legit, not some random person with sketchy intentions. 

Give them a quick idea of who you are so they know you're trustworthy. Point them to where they can see your work to judge its quality and decide if it matches their style.

Also, show them some **love.** This is something people often forget. Drop a line like, "I really liked that part in your video," or "That line in your last blog post was spot-on." It helps them see that you're genuinely interested in their content and not just trying to use them to reach more people.

**Here's an example of what you could say:**

*"Hey there, David! I've been following your awesome content and am a content marketer at XXX.  We're a small startup that helps people to ……. I've shared some of your genius advice with our audience before, which is totally true – I linked to your stuff!*

*Since all our customers are kick starting their own businesses, I make it my mission to share the best tips out there to support them on their journey. And that's why I'm reaching out to you. This week, I'm diving into the world of influencer outreach. Any chance you could share some of your ideas?*

*By the way, how do you prefer to be contacted? I'd be thrilled to share your thoughts with our audience of …… Thanks a bunch for your time, and keep rocking that fantastic content.*

*Cheers!"*

See, this text looks friendly and straightforward. Remember, this is all about building a connection and showing that you genuinely value their insights. 

### Research Before You Interview

Imagine, you're about to interview someone, but you haven't done any research. It's like showing up to a game without knowing the rules – not a good look, right?

So, first things first, **dig into the topic** you'll be discussing and learn about the person you're interviewing. Let's say you're interviewing a crypto expert. If you walk in without understanding the basics of cryptocurrencies, it will be tough to ask meaningful questions. You want your audience to really get what your interviewee brings to the table.

For example, let's talk about NFT. If you're chatting with a NFT pro, make sure you know the difference between NFTs and digital art in general. If you mess that up, it could give off the vibe that you haven't tried to understand their world. And that might affect how they view you down the road.

Keep an eye on the **news** too. If there's something major happening in the crypto world, know about it.  

And here's a cool tip: check out a bit about their **personal background**, if they have a family, hobbies, or interests. It's like finding common ground. You can start with some friendly chit-chat before diving into the main talk. It helps break the ice and makes the conversation flow smoothly.

\
**How to Ask Great Questions**

*"All I've tried to do is ask the best questions I could think of, listen to the answers and then follow up. I've never not followed up. I don't attack anybody—that's not my style—but I follow up," - Larry King.*

![How to ask great questions ](/blog/assets/подготовка-к-успешному-интервью.png "How to ask great questions ")

Hosting an interview is like being a tour guide through a fascinating conversation. Let's explore how to make your questions truly shine.

* Before you start, consider who will be tuning in and who your guest is. Tailor your questions to what your audience would love to know and what your guest is an expert in.
* Begin with a friendly question that sets a positive tone. It could be about the guest's background, their journey, or something they're passionate about.
* Mix up your questions. Ask some light, fun questions to keep things engaging. But don't shy away from diving into deeper, thought-provoking topics too.
* Imagine your conversation as a story. Start with an introduction, ease into the main topics, and finish off smoothly. It's like taking your listeners on a journey.
* Show genuine interest in your guest's responses. Listen carefully; if they mention something intriguing, don't hesitate to ask follow-up questions. These questions can't be answered with a simple "yes" or "no." They encourage your guests to share insights and stories, making the conversation more engaging.
* Find common ground with your guest. Mention something you both relate to or appreciate from their work. It helps build rapport and makes the conversation more enjoyable.
* Sometimes, the conversation might take an unexpected turn. Be ready to adapt your questions based on how the chat evolves.

Having a list of questions is great, but don't be afraid to let the conversation flow naturally. If something interesting comes up, explore it.

### Question Examples for Crypto Influencers

![Write Questions For Influencers ](/blog/assets/письмо1.png "Write Questions For Influencers ")

Here is a simple plan and question ideas that you can use when preparing for an interview:

**1. Introduction and Background**

* *Can you share a bit about your journey into the crypto space and how you became involved?*

**3. Discuss the Role of Education**

### Choosing Between In-Person or Online Interview 

**1. In-person Interview** 

When you're setting up an in-person interview, choosing the right location is key. A cozy café could be a great option. You want a calm place for recording but not so formal that it puts everyone on edge. You know, no sterile white walls or awkward silences that make people squirm. That kind of setting doesn't exactly lead to candid, comfortable answers.

**2. Interviewing Over the Phone or Computer**

These days, a lot of interviews happen over Zoom or other online platforms. The place you choose to sit is super important. Picture it like finding your own little sound bubble. You don't want folks barging in and out while you're talking. Imagine you're in a tiny phone booth or a conference room at work. You'd want a quiet spot where interruptions are at a minimum.

And here's a lesson we've learned the hard way – listen closely if you're planning to repurpose that audio later, like in a course or a blog post. Clear audio is your golden ticket. To achieve that, you've got to find a place where your voice is the show's star, without any distracting background noise.

So, the setting matters whether you're meeting face-to-face or chatting online. Think cozy for in-person talks and quiet for virtual ones. After all, the right surroundings can make your interview shine!

## Repurpose Interviews

After the interview, you can use your materials and make some additional content for your blog or website: 

**\
Blog Posts:** One interview session can sprout not just one but three captivating blog posts. Each post could explore different angles and key takeaways or even delve deeper into specific topics discussed during the interview.

**Transcripts that Matter:** Don't let those spoken gems go to waste. Your interview transcripts can serve as written content, making it easy for readers who prefer to skim or read at their own pace.

**Front and Center Pull Quote:** Imagine extracting a standout quote from your interview and proudly displaying it on your website's front page. It's like a taste of the interview's essence that draws people in.

**Course Enrichment:** If you're creating a course, interviews can be goldmines. You can sprinkle sound bites, quotes or even include the full video or recording as supplementary material. It adds real-world insights and keeps your course engaging.

**Social Media:** The interview's best bits can become shareable social media posts. A quick quote, a teaser video, or an interesting fact can capture attention and drive engagement.

**Podcasts:** If you're into podcasting, interviews are podcasting gold. Convert the interview into an episode and share your insights with an even wider audience.

**E-books or Guides:** Compile a collection of interviews around a specific theme and create an e-book or guide. It's like packaging valuable insights into a neat, downloadable package.

**Email Newsletter:** Share snippets, key learnings, or teaser clips with your email subscribers. It's a great way to keep them engaged and excited about your content.

## Advantages and Challenges of Interviews 

Hosting interviews with prominent figures, experts, or influencers in the crypto space can enhance your brand's credibility and authority. Plus, collaborations with influencers and experts introduce your brand to their followers, expanding your reach within the crypto community.

The interactive nature of interviews promotes audience engagement, as viewers ask questions and share thoughts, enhancing your online presence. In addition, these discussions serve as educational tools, simplifying complex concepts for newcomers and aiding audience understanding.

Networking is another great opportunity with influential figures, potentially leading to partnerships and collaborations. 

However, organizing an interview can be challenging and take your time and effort. 

**Here are some common challenges that can arise when hosting interviews:**

**Scheduling Conflicts:** Coordinating suitable interview times that align with both your and your interviewee's schedules can be tricky, especially if they're in a different time zone or have a busy agenda.

**Technical Glitches:** Technical issues such as poor audio quality, internet disruptions, or software glitches can interrupt the smooth flow of the interview.

**Nervous Guests:** Some interviewees might feel nervous or camera-shy, affecting their ability to express themselves comfortably and naturally.

**Unanticipated Answers:** Interviewees might provide unexpected or unscripted answers, requiring quick thinking and adaptability to keep the conversation on track.

**Balancing Speaking Time:** Striking the right balance between asking questions and giving the interviewee enough time to elaborate without dominating the conversation can be delicate.

**Staying on Topic:** Ensuring the interview stays focused on the intended topic or theme can be challenging, especially if the conversation drifts naturally.

**Technical Setup:** Ensuring proper lighting, camera angles, and equipment setup for in-person or virtual interviews can be challenging, affecting the overall visual and audio quality.

**Unexpected Disturbances:** Background noise, interruptions, or unexpected distractions can disrupt the interview and require adaptability.

**Editing and Post-Production:** Once the interview is recorded, editing and post-production can be time-consuming, especially if there are technical issues to address or content to condense.

**Promotion and Engagement:** Effectively promoting the interview and engaging the audience through various channels requires a well-thought-out strategy.
