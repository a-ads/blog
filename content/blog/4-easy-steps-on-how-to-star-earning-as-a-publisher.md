For more than a decade, we have been revolutionising the world of cryptocurrency advertising, helping numerous publishers earn annual revenue through our ad network. Over the years, we have welcomed thousands of publishers to our platform, and we are excited to have you join us and receive a portion of our lucrative advertising budget.



Before proceeding with the further steps, I'd like to explain what a publisher means.

A publisher is an individual who owns digital content or audience, including apps or websites. When the owner offers up space within the property for external ads, also known as ad inventory, it becomes an ad publisher.

The main reason why publishers offer space on websites or apps is for monetization. Publishers will then receive income when advertisements are shown on their websites. If you want to earn with [a.ads.com](https://a-ads.com/) as a publisher, you should follow the steps and meet the criteria.



Here are the two criteria checklist to pass before you can be a publisher on a.ads.com:



1. You need to have a website or an application audience or traffic

2. You need to have genuine traffic. We do not accept fake traffic.



We retain a fixed 20% fee on any advertising budget while the rest goes to our publishers, and if new advertisers come with your [affiliate link](https://a-ads.com/blog/2018-10-04-become-our-affiliate-partner-and-take-50-of-our-fees/), you are entitled to 50% of our fee.

Here are the steps to start earning as a publisher:



1. CREATE YOUR ACCOUNT: Go to this page, [a.ads.com,](https://a-ads.com/) at the top right corner, click sign up and input your email. Your password will be sent to your email then you can log in with it. 

2. CREATE AN AD UNIT: Creating an ad unit takes only a few minutes, where you get the code that will be embedded in the website or application. 

Click on create an ad unit on the homepage or click [here](https://a-ads.com/ad_units/new).



Step 1. Select the ad unit type, which can either be a website or an application, according to what you have. 

Step 2. Select the ad unit dimension or size you want. Please take note of the space on your website or application before selecting a size to make sure the size can fit into the available space on your website or application. By the way, our ad units are adaptive.

Step 3. Input the page URL. It is the website or application page you want the ad unit to be on.



3. PLACE YOUR AD UNIT CODE: Placing your ad unit code on your website and blog requires a guide. Please read this on [how to place ad unit code.](https://a-ads.com/blog/how-to-place-an-ad-unit-code-correctly/)



4. SET UP YOUR WITHDRAWAL DETAILS: [click here](https://a-ads.com/blog/how-to-change-and-confirm-a-withdrawal-address/) and follow the instructions on how to set up your funds. 



KINDLY NOTE

We are not a pay-per-click or pay-per-impression network. We distribute advertisers' budgets to ad units targeted by them concerning various metrics. 

The one magic word you need to learn to earn with us is ["unique impression."](https://a-ads.com/blog/2018-10-04-counting-unique-impressions/) 

The more you have, the better your earning prospects are as long as your traffic is good. 

Advertisers can also reward ad units for useful actions performed by their visitors.

We do not guarantee earnings as earnings are based on the factors listed below:

\- number of unique impressions

\- number of unique clicks

\- advertising campaigns that target your ad unit

\- content filters defined for the ad unit

\- ad unit display rate

\- size and location of an ad unit on a website page

\- the quality of traffic.

Don't hesitate to get in touch with the support team if you have any issues creating an ad unit.
