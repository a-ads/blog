You have two types of balance: user balance and ad unit balance.

These two withdrawal places mean that you could either: 

1. Send your earnings from ad unit balance to user balance and withdraw from there or 
2. Withdraw straight from ad unit balance.

You can then withdraw:

1. Directly to a bitcoin address or
2. Indirectly via Faucetsystem (automatic instant real-time withdrawal).

If you have many ad units it is simpler to accumulate earnings at the user account to withdraw straight to a bitcoin wallet. In our network the minimum threshold for withdrawal to a wallet is 100,000 satoshi. Otherwise you can withdraw through Faucetsystem in smaller portions. Faucetsystem has its own small withdrawal fee but its threshold is a lot lower: 20,000 satoshi.

To configure these options go to:

1. User account -> Settings -> Edit withdrawal settings -> Withdrawal type/withdrawal threshold
2. Ad unit account -> Finances -> Withdrawal options -> Withdrawal type
