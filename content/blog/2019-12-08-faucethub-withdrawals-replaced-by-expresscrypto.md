Since faucethub.io stops maintaining its services, we've replaced it with an alternative service - expresscrypto.io. Thus our publishers keep the opportunity to withdraw little sums.

As FaucetHub withdrawals are no longer supported, please, change your withdrawal settings. You can enable ExpressCrypto withdrawals in your user or ad unit withdrawal settings.

You won't face any withdrawal threshold to withdraw from A-Ads.com as ExpressCrypto allows 1-satoshi transactions. The withdrawal fee for any withdrawals from ExpressCrypto to bitcoin addresses is fixed and counts 500 satoshis, and there's no withdrawal threshold.

Faucets, lotteries, altcoin deposits and withdrawals, a crypto exchange service, a referral program, and other services are also available at ExpressCrypto.

We believe that ExpressCrypto is a legit service, but we can't guarantee the safety of the funds sent to them. Please use it at your own risk!
