Neural networks are a type of machine learning that functions on the principles of the human brain. Artificial neurons are used in neural networks to perform on "examples" - data arrays. For instance, the DALL-E neural network studies various freely available images to generate images from a user's text query. The network identifies objects in the picture and reproduces them in different variations. As with the human brain, the more information a neural network has, the more complete and valid its output will be.

Neural networks are successful in imitating intelligence and human speech (ChatGPT), generating images of different content and style (DALL-E 2, Midjourney), creating animated videos (Make-A-Video), and used in many areas: from agriculture to data processing. In this article, we will learn how neural networks can also be actively used in marketing.

**Here are some ways neural networks can be used in business:**

* **Personalization:** Neural networks help collect and analyze large amounts of user information to create recommendations and personalized content.
* **Automatic content creation:** They can generate product descriptions, headlines for news articles, posts for social media, and more.
* **Video and image analysis:** They can identify objects in an image and recognize people's faces, moods, and more. They can help optimize images on social media or a website.
* **Improving the effectiveness of advertising:** Neural networks can be used to optimize targeting or choose the most appropriate ad format for each audience. It can increase conversion rates and reduce advertising costs.

Let's look at several neural networks that can help you with your marketing strategies:

## **1. ChatGPT** 

[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/auth/login) is a remarkable achievement resulting from years of dedicated research by OpenAI. This company has been a pioneering force in the field of artificial intelligence since 2015.

At its core, ChatGPT is a language model that has the potential to enable neural networks to communicate with humans on equal footing by simulating human speech. The model is designed to learn from existing texts generated by humans and interacts in a dialogue mode.

**What it can do:** ChatGPT's capabilities are vast, including generating texts of various formats such as articles, press releases, notes, posts, and letters, as well as translating content from one language to another. Moreover, it can create ads and scripts for videos and even generate SEO-optimized hashtags.

**Cost:** While ChatGPT is free to use, registration is required. For users who need additional features and faster text generation, a $20 subscription is available. 

## **2. DALL-E 2**

[DALL-E 2 i](https://openai.com/product/dall-e-2)s a remarkable development from OpenAI, which harnesses the power of neural networks to generate original art from text descriptions. The resulting images resemble real paintings, and users can even upload and edit their photos using text prompts. While the neural network was initially available only by invitation, it is now accessible to everyone.

\
**What it can do:** With DALL-E 2, users can create stunning images based on text descriptions and fine-tune pre-existing pictures with customizable color filters and styles. 

**Cost:** The neural network offers 200 free image generations for the first month and 60 every following month, with the option to purchase additional generations for $15 per 460 pieces.

## **3. You.com**

[You.com](https://you.com/search?q=how+to+write+well&fromSearchBar=true&tbm=youchat) is another exciting tool that offers a feature not found on Google. It includes a built-in chatbot, similar to ChatGPT, which can answer questions and engage in user dialogue.

**What it can do:** Besides answering questions, You.com can generate headlines, social media posts, emails, and texts in various styles, such as formal, friendly, or witty. It can also create images based on text descriptions.

**Cost:** As for the price, ten texts will cost nothing, and users even don't need registration. Paid plans start at $10 per month.

## **4. Anyword**
