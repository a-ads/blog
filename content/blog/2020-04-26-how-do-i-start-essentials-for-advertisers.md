## 1. Create a campaign

To start, please, [create a campaign](https://a-ads.com/campaigns/new).

**1.1. Choose your advertising payment model**

Our main payment model is [Daily budget](https://a-ads.com/blog/2019-08-11-how-does-daily-budget-work/): you spend a fixed amount of money per day and get a share of our publishers’ traffic.  [CPM bids](https://a-ads.com/blog/2020-03-11-how-to-use-cpm-bids-with-a-ads/) are also available, but Daily budget is preferable because when you pay per day, you are not being charged for fake impressions.

You can set any daily budget, that seems reasonable to you. Please, mind checking the traffic estimations at "Campaign -> Payment model" page and note that they are volatile and might not be accurate, especially if you have a narrow targeting and low budget.

**1.2. Create advertisement**

A-ADS offers non-intrusive advertising, that's why we support only text ads and graphic banners. We do not serve popunders nor popups, moreover, our ads don't contain JavaScript and don't leave cookies until visitors click the ads.

Each ad must have a text version and may include graphic banners. A text version is required because it is used as a fallback in a case if a graphic banner can’t be displayed. Graphic banners must be in PNG, JPEG and GIF formats, up to 700 kB per file. The most popular sizes are 300х250, 468х60, 728х90. The [more banners](https://a-ads.com/blog/2020-03-27-faq-for-advertisers/) you have, the better.

## 2. Configure your campaign (optional)

Most of the campaign settings are available after you create one. If you want to fine-tune your campaign, you can go to the campaign page and choose site categories, specify geo-targeting or set other options if necessary.

E. g., if you want to advertise a crypto-related business, you might be interested in the following categories: Bitcoin, Earning online, and possibly Business and Finance. You can choose them on your "Campaign -> Traffic sources -> Selection Criteria" page. The full list of publishing websites is available in the [catalog](https://a-ads.com/catalog).

## 3. Deposit funds

We currently accept deposits in Bitcoin and 20+ other cryptocurrencies. You can deposit any sum to your campaign or user account. Please note that your user balance will automatically be used to fund your started campaigns. So if you do not want your campaigns to use your user balance, then please pause them.

## 4. Wait for traffic

There are several stages which need to be completed before your you can see the traffic stats on the campaign page:

* Deposit confirmation (by Bitcoin network or payment processor)
* Deposit processing by A-ADS
* Ad moderation by A-ADS moderators
* Allocation of advertising budgets to targeted ad units
* Delivery of ad impressions
* Statistics collection

Usually, it takes minutes to hours for your funded campaign to get started, but sometimes it may take longer. If it doesn’t start within 24 hours, then please contact support.
