According to the latest updates in our advertising network, "Impressions" defaults to "all impressions." "Globally unique impressions" are now called "guImpressions." The same goes for clicks: "clicks" means "all clicks," and "guClicks" means "globally unique clicks". It's important to note that the number of globally unique impressions determines a publisher's earnings, so there have been no changes in the earnings logic.

**How are globally unique impressions counted?**

Each unique IP address within the AADS network is counted as a globally unique impression once every 24 hours. It means that when a visitor, represented by a single IP, views our ads on any of our publishing sites for the first time, it creates a unique impression. Throughout the rest of the day, regardless of the sites or pages they visit, or the ads they see, this visitor's IP will not generate any additional [unique impressions](https://aads.com/blog/counting-unique-impressions/).

To calculate earnings for publishers, only globally unique impressions are considered. But, in order to make the metrics presentation convenient for all clients, our network displays all impressions as well.
